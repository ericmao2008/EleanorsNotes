It's my strongly-held belief that taxes are a lot more interesting than people give them credit for; that's one of the reasons [I wrote about them back in October](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/taxes/). They seem pretty boring because we tend to focus on the normal ones like income taxes and trade tariffs... and because school conditioned most of us to find word problems tiresome.  

Back when I was in law school, I took a tax law class. Somehow, that was the first time I was ever exposed to the idea that taxes served a policy purpose beyond “getting money for the government to use.” Many taxes codes are designed to incentivize (or punish) particular behaviors; the latter are generally known as "sin taxes." For example, adult nightclubs, strip clubs, gambling, alcohol, gasoline and candies are lucrative for modern governments; they attract buyers and generate revenue, but generally people don't fuss too much about the government trying to make them more expensive and thus, harder to acquire. 

Sometimes this backfires. In 1696, the English had to pay taxes based on the number of windows in their homes. It was probably meant as a sort of wealth tax, but people just bricked up their windows in their house. Ironically, bricks were also taxed, but eventually the window tax [took such a toll on public health that it was repealed after about 150 years](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nation-world/nine-weird-taxes-from-around-the-world/window-tax/slideshow/56516226.cms). After years of builders increasing brick size to avoid the brick tax, it was eliminated in 1850.



King Henry I gave knights two choices; fight or pay taxes. The tax was affordable, and many knights would pay the tax instead of fighting. The tax remained the same in the era of King Stephen. But then King John took over, and he saw this tax as a cowardice tax. Thus, King John increased it by 300%, forcing the knights to fight.






Peter the Great of Russia liked the idea of Russia having clean-shaven men like western Europe. At first, he tried [outright banning beards](https://theculturetrip.com/europe/russia/articles/the-controversial-history-of-russian-beards/), but that went over pretty poorly; he had to settle for a beard tax, which persisted for nearly 50 years past his death. Beards are still pretty controversial in Russia, from what I understand, at least in part because of this cultural tension. 

I bet you haven’t heard of urine tax in your entire life. Let me enlighten you about this special urine tax. Vespasian, a Roman emperor, is said to have taxed urine in the first century A.D. Too absurd? Well, the thought behind it wasn’t too irrational. Urine contains ammonia, and back then, launderers used it to clean togas (seen in historical Roman movies? The distinct clothes they wear are called Togas). Urine is said to be useful in tanning as well, and thus the buyers of urine were taxed collected from public urinals.


You must have heard that knights were glorious and paid heavily to fight wars. I have discovered something else; Knights who pay to avoid fighting wars.
