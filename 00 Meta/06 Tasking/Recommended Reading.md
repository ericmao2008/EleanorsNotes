## History

- [the Archaeology of Seasonality](http://www.brepols.net/Pages/ShowProduct.aspx?prod_id=IS-9782503593951-1) studies the cycle of seasons throughout the ancient world. 
- [Textiles the whole story](https://thamesandhudson.com/textiles-the-whole-story-9780500291139) is a vibrantly illustrated book, is an original look at the myriad roles played by textiles in all aspects of human life, from ancient weavings to light-sensitive and other futuristic fabrics of our own era; [recommended by TinkerBot](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/700466324840775831/935716870017921034) and should be a good complement to [[The Golden Thread by Kassia St Clair]]

### Eurasian Plains

* [The Horde : How the Mongols Changed the World (eBook, 2021)](https://www.worldcat.org/title/horde-how-the-mongols-changed-the-world/oclc/1253313967?referer=list_view)
	* Recommended by @person72443 on [twitter](https://twitter.com/person72443/status/1420670921103142919) because of a [New York Review piece](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2021/07/22/pleasure-domes-and-postal-routes/)
	* An epic history of the Mongols as we have never seen them--not just conquerors but also city builders, diplomats, and supple economic thinkers who constructed one of the most influential empires in history. The Mongols are widely known for one thing: conquest. For three hundred years, the Horde was no less a force in global development than Rome had been. It left behind a profound legacy in Europe, Russia, Central Asia, and the Middle East, palpable to this day. Favereau takes us inside one of the most powerful sources of cross-border integration in world history. The Horde was the central node in the Eurasian commercial boom of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and was a conduit for exchanges across thousands of miles. Its unique political regime--a complex power-sharing arrangement among the khan and the nobility--rewarded skillful administrators and diplomats and fostered an economic order that was mobile, organized, and innovative. From its capital at Sarai on the lower Volga River, the Horde provided a governance model for Russia, influenced social practice and state structure across Islamic cultures, disseminated sophisticated theories about the natural world, and introduced novel ideas of religious tolerance. Challenging conceptions of nomads as peripheral to history, Favereau makes clear that we live in a world inherited from the Mongol moment.

### Mesoamerica

* [The Incas (eBook, 2014)](https://www.worldcat.org/title/incas/oclc/866563832?referer=list_view)
	* Recommended from rAskHistorians probably
* The Incan Army: Volume II Strategy, Tactics and Logistics – has some stuff about the Incan education system 
* Hassig's *Mexico and the Spanish Conquest* incorporates a lot of the scholarship he's done on Aztec warfare and recounts the Conquest with an eye towards understanding the Aztec perspective, rather than just regurgitating Spanish accounts. (per [[Tlahuizcalpantecutli]])

### Mediterranean
* [Ritualised friendship and the Greek city (Book, 2002)](https://www.worldcat.org/title/ritualised-friendship-and-the-greek-city/oclc/1030083451?referer=list_view)
* [While Rome burned : fire, leadership, and urban disaster in the Roman cultural imagination (Book, 2020)](https://www.worldcat.org/title/while-rome-burned-fire-leadership-and-urban-disaster-in-the-roman-cultural-imagination/oclc/1124905303?referer=list_view)

* N. Luraghi, The Ancient Messenians (Cambridge, 2008) is the best single work on the Messenians, going over the history of the people and the region from the Greek Dark Ages to the Imperial Roman period.

### Mediterranean & Near East
* Letters of the Great Kings of the Ancient Near East by Trevor Bryce – This is similar in content to [[Brotherhood of Kings by Amanda Podany]], but Bryce focuses on the Late Bronze Age specifically, particularly the role of the Hittites in Late Bronze Age diplomacy. Since Podany's book ends in the Amarna period (ca. 1350-1330 BCE) and does not cover the Egyptian-Hittite relations of the Ramesside period, this focus on the Hittites is helpful.
* International Relations in the Ancient Near East by Mario Liverani – This is a very dry but important book, and Liverani has influenced how every ancient historian analyzes the Late Bronze Age. Rather than write a history of kings and trade goods, Liverani focuses on the ideology and realpolitik of Bronze Age diplomacy, which makes it a very nice companion volume to Podany's book. You may want to check to see if it's been translated into your native tongue.
* Amarna Diplomacy: The Beginnings of International Relations edited by Raymond Cohen and Raymond Westbrook – This is a very unusual book in ancient Near Eastern studies, since it includes contributions not only by Egyptologists and ancient Near Eastern historians but also specialists in political science and international relations.
* To learn more about the people and places discussed in [[In Search of the Phoenicians by Josephine Quinn]], the most up-to-date syntheses of research on Phoenician history and archaeology are Bondì et al. (2009), Elayi (2013), and Morstadt (2015). English language overviews include Markoe (2000), Aubet (2001), Woolmer (2011), and, with a particular emphasis on Carthage and the west, Lancel (1995), van Dommelen and Gómez Bellard (2008b), Hoyos (2010), and Miles (2010). Recent essay collections give a glimpse of current scholarly preoccupations: Jiménez (2010), Xella (2013b), Quinn and Vella (2014b), and Garbati and Pedrazzi (2015).

### Prehistoric Art
* Sacred Darkness: A Global Perspective on the Ritual Use of Caves ed Holley Moyes, 2014
* Sigfried Giedion, "Space Coinceptioin in Prehistoric Art," in Explorations in Communication, 1960
* Ancient China and Its Enemies: The Rise of Nomadic Power in East Asian History by Nicola Di Cosmo "I got this under the impression it was an account of the Xiongnu Empire and its wars with Han China. It is, in part, that, but Di Cosmo casts his net rather wider, covering also the archaeology of China's early northern fringes, the history of the Rong and Di peoples who preceeded the Xiongnu as China's northern neighbours, and Sima Qian's methods and aims in writing of the Xiongnu in the Shiji. I found it extremely interesting, especially the sections on the rise of horseback nomadism in eastern Asia and on the Rong and Di (who were not horseback nomads but agriculturalists and footslogger pastoralists)."

- Ronald James' "Knockers, Knackers, and Ghosts: Immigrant Folklore in the Western Mines" offers a good breakdown of how goblin-adjacent creatures get antisemitic tropes, and how the Atlantic voyage eliminates them.

## Bureaucracy

* Paul David, in his 1994 article "Why are institutions the Carriers of History?" and the idea has been reaffirmed multiple times, notably by Douglas North in 2005 ("Understanding the Process of Economic Change") and Avner Greif in 2006 ( "Institutions and the path to the Modern Economy").
