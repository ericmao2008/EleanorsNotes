## Refactoring Notes

Obsidian makes it easy to move text around in large chunks. You can order information in a variety of ways, at different levels of granularity. This is similar to the concept of `refactoring` in programming, which means to restructure (code, usually) to improve the operation without changing how the (program, usually) functions. For my purposes this means rearranging information to make it easier to absorb, without changing the actual content. 

- At a granular level, there are a couple of ways to [[swap content locations]].
- You can also [[merge and split files]].

## Key plugins

- Dataview allows for complex, mysql-like queries of structured information. It allows for the generation of tables collecting information from a variety of different files. Many of my notes about locations and characters are populated using Dataview, for example [[Kala]].
