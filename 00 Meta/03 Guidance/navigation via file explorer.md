The **file explorer** mirrors the structure of your files on your hard drive. You can see the _file_ contents of multiple folders at once, not just subfolders. 

Clicking on a file will open it. Right clicking it will give you options like `open in new pane` or `rename`. 

You can assign hotkeys for any of these commands; `ctrl/cmd+click` will by default open it in a new pane.
