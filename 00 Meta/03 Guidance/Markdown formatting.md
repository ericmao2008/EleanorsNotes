Markdown formatting for Obsidian has most of the same features that you might find on Discord, Reddit, or GitHub. Here's [a cheat sheet](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes), or you can download and install the [Markdown Formatting Assistant plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=markdown%20formatting%20assistant), which will give you a point-and-click graphical interface similar to what you might find in Google Docs or Microsoft Word. 

The basics are: 

```
## level 2 heading
### level 3 heading (etc)
*italics* or _italics_
**bold** or __bold__ 
~~strikethrough~~
