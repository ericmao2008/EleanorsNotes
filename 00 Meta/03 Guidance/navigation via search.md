**Searching** for files works best if you're not sure what it's called, where it is, or what it's connected to â€” but you know what its _contents_ should be, particularly if it has been given a `#tag`. For example the search is a great way to find all `#actionItem`s. 

Obsidian supports Boolean operators like `and`, `or`, and `not`. It also lets you toggle case sensitivity. the `?` icon will explain in plain language how Obsidian is interpreting your search. 

Clicking on a `#tag` will automatically populate the search bar. Note: you can actually [embed searches](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Search#Embed+search+results) into notes using a \`\`\`query.
