* 00 Meta
	* 01 Attachments (sometimes attachments wind up in other places, this isn't a hard-and-fast "attachments only go here" thing)
	* 02 Pending (I try to use this folder sparingly, mostly for my Tasking file and scratchpads that link to other apps that depend on a 'default file' opening, aka Writemonkey. I guess it's like an Inbox?) 
	* 03 Structure (these are my meta-notes about how my vault is structured, and where I put my "example notes" for things like the [Palatinate snippets](https://github.com/eleanorkonik/-palatinate))
	* 04 Templates
	* 05 Tools (I keep "index notes" about external tools for different workflows here, for example my "research tools" has Zotero and Unpaywall and such on it. I also have one for useful Obsidian plugins that get asked about a lot) 
* 10 Dated
	* 11 Daily Roundups (this is where my daily notes — [see link for template](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/a-template-for-daily-notes/15619/5) — go) 
	* 12 Feedback (this is where my edit letters, fiction critique obligations, etc go). 
	* 13 Monthly Roundups (this is where the raw data dumps for monthly spaced repetition / reflection stuff go)
* 20 Personal 
	* 21 Parenting
	* 22 School (mostly papers I wrote in college)
	* 23 Teaching (I know JD is all about the "no more than 2 levels deep" but let's be real, that's a guideline, not a rule, and I could have a whole JD-style vault for JUST teaching materials, so be gentle)
		* global-studies (this is the class I've taught most often. I used to have subfolders for every year, but I wound up re-using stuff often enough that I just use the numerical numbering system my curriculum gives to pre-pend filenames and it works fine)
		* hiring-materials (resumes, cover letters, particularly showcase-y things, etc)
		* psych
		* us-gov
		* us-history
	* 24 Taxes
		* 2017
		* 2018
		* 2019
		* 2020
	* 25 Legal (wills, copies of my ID cards, contracts, etc)
	* 26 Medical
	* 27 House
	* 28 Events (Mostly stuff like [this Thanksgiving reflection](https://www.instagram.com/p/BdaxL4UDmCA/) so I can keep track of how much food was useful to have for next year, lol) 
	* 29 Activism (records of letters I've written to congressmen, reference notes for charities I'm involved with, etc)
* 30 Interests
	* 31 Programming
	* 32 Games
	* 33 Gardening
	* 34 Writing
* 40 Slipbox (as in Zettelkasten) 
	* 41 Indexes 
	* 42 Encyclopaedic (this is stuff that isn't "properly atomic" because it's more "overview" style but still heavily paraphrased and mashed up from various sources) 
	* 43 References (yeah yeah yeah it's three layers deep, but you can surely see why) 
		* 43.01 Books (literature notes, long but processed, with lots of direct quotations and annotations)
		* 43.02 Journals (literature notes but on journal articles)
		* 43.03 Discussions (honestly these are mostly raw dumps of conversations from Discord that I want to refer back to later)
		* 43.04 Audiovisual (notes on youtube videos and podcasts)
		* 43.05 PDFs (this is where Zotfile puts all of my academic PDFs it downloads from the internet — see [this guide](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-zotfile-mdnotes-obsidian-dataview-workflow/15536) for details)
		* 43.06 Zotdumps (this is where Zotfile puts all of my raw annotations, as described in the guide linked above)
* 50 Worldbuilding 
	* 51 Verraine (notes for my epic fantasy universe — could easily be a wiki by itself)
	* 52 GeneE (my science fiction universe)
	* 53 Neith (my urban fantasy universe)
* 60 Characters
	* 61 Character Ideas (this is where I keep useful references like "a list of verbal tics I brainstormed" and "different ways to describe a person's nose)
	* 62 Character References 
	* b. ATA 100-199 (ATA indicates that these are characters from Verraine who were born during that timeframe. Since I write a lot of flash fiction and characters might appear in multiple stories, it's easier to keep track of this way). 
	* b. ATA 200-299 ("ATA" stands for "After the Archivist" aka after the invention of written records) 
	* b. CE 1900-2099 (I can tell at a glance that this is my urban fantasy universe)
	* b. AGA 2250 (AG stands for "After Globalization Achieved") 
* 70 Newsletters (I write my [weekly research roundup newsletter](https://eleanorkonik.com/subscribe/) in markdown in Obsidian, they're organized by date. I separate them from my daily&weekly notes by using a 2021.03.21 format instead of dashes or W03 for example, so my navigation searches stay clean)
* 80 Stories
	* 81 Universes (these are the "master" files for Verraine, which has an overview summary and relies on dataview to pull all stories set in this universe)
	* 82 Indexes (these are basically the "table of contents" pages for individual novels)
	* 83 Pitch materials (queries, blurbs, elevator pitches, etc)
	* 84 Prose
	* 85 Snippets (deleted scenes, scribbled ideas, snatches of a scene, etc)
	* 86 Publication (information about different markets, resources for self-pub, etc) 
	* 87 Marketing
* 90 Articles
	* 91 Images
	* 92 Seeds
	* 93 Recurring (notes for recurring features like my [reading roundups](https://eleanorkonik.com/reading-roundup-edible-entrails-self-fermenting-wine/) or [Thesis Thursday](https://eleanorkonik.com/3-theses-3rd-thursday-on-writing/)) 
	* 94 Published 
	* 95 Nonfic Markets (mostly indexes that leverage dataview and formatting guides. My "seeds" folder has like eleven billion things in it so I really rely on dataview and these index pages to see what I've got going on)
