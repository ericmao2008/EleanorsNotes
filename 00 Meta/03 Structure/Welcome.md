Welcome to the personal notes of Eleanor Konik. This vault is meant to showcase how I personally use Obsidian to manage a variety of things. Because it’s a live website, some details (like metadata and comments) are hidden.

If you’d like to download a significantly less sanitized version of this vault that will allow the plugins to actually do their thing, the `.zip` of my notes is available to [subscribers to the Iceberg, my research & fiction newsletter](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/membership/). Be warned, though — thar be spoilers! 

If you’re interested in reading my [articles about notetaking knowledge management](https://www.obsidianroundup.org/tag/thoughts), check them out over at the Obsidian Roundup. If you want a synthesized version of my notes and access to my fiction, as well as weekly analysis of educational history-and-biology related topics, subscribe to my [newsletter](http://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/). I’m also pretty active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EleanorKonik) and use it as a space to discuss [[Impacts of Increasing Population Density|questions]] that come up in my research. 

For a reasonably good overview of how my vault is structured, I maintain the most [up to date list](https://eleanorkonik.com/obsidian-for-writing/) of resources and walk-throughs and such on my website. You can also check out an explanation of [[JD System 2021-11-10|my folder structure]] right here in these notes. 

There's also this graph, which only includes the contents of my "nonfiction notes" (slipbox), stories, and newsletters, to show how interconnected all of those things are:

Overwhelmed by all the files on the left & looking for somewhere to start? Check out my notes about [[textiles]], [[economics]] or [[domestication]]. 

If you see a broken link, it probably links to a file that was too big to upload, or something I changed the name of and haven’t properly updated, or a restricted file, like an article I’m still working on, or a note that contains personal information about other people (i.e. my child, or attendees to a party I’m planning using Obsidian). For that reason, my daily notes are also not included in the public-facing vault; there’s a lot of personal notes hidden in those fleeting notes.
