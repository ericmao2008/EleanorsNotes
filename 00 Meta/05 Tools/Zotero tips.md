there are both placeholders (e.g. `{{citekey}}`) and wildcards (e.g. `%(citekey)` for all fields. The first are a quick way to get `- <name of field>: <field content>` and allows you to apply some formatting. The 2nd one are the raw contents of that field. Zotero is a bit weird with fields and not all types of items have all fields, so, the important thing to remember is that `{{placeholders}}` are removed from your template if the item you're exporting doesn't have it, while `%(wildcards)` will be left there, and should be used sparingly for things you know all items will have, e.g. title, authors, citekey, date (although in the talk we saw podcasts don't have date for some reason)
