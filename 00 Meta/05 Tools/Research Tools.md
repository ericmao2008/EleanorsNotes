## Connection Discovery Tools

* https://www.researchrabbitapp.com/ - super nice people, very responsive and nice in the chat window, they will even do a zoom walk through, lots of neat features like being able to write notes to self about key references. 
* https://citationgecko.com/ - doesn't do a great job of saving stuff long term but has a nice simple interface that is sometimes nice. 
* https://www.connectedpapers.com/
* https://www.semanticscholar.org/ - seems more like a searchable database than what it claims to be but maybe I'm just using it wrong. 
* https://scite.ai/home - input an article, get back a chart of what cited it and whether it agreed, disagreed, or just mentioned it. 
* https://iris.ai - a nice visual connection tool. 

## Searchable Databases

* https://academia.edu - note, really spammy (no I did not publish anything as E. Konik let me turn this off please), but mostly free. [Probably not ethical, though](https://www.forbes.com/sites/drsarahbond/2017/01/23/dear-scholars-delete-your-account-at-academia-edu/?sh=62edcb502d62). 
* https://jstor.org - 100 articles free per month. Also has the [analyzer](https://www.jstor.org/analyze/) that analyzes the text within the document to find key topics and terms used, and then uses the ones it deems most important — the "prioritized terms" — to find similar content in JSTOR. 
* I'm using https://www.worldcat.org/ to keep track of books I'd like to request from the library via interlibrary loan, along with the [list on aacpl](https://catalog.aacpl.net/MyAccount/MyList/23776) of the books that are available without interlibrary loan. 
* https://hcommons.org/ is a bit more ... social, than I prefer, but might have some useful stuff. 
* https://booksc.org/s/ is definitely an illegal ebook and article database, but it also works and downloading academic pdfs is definitely a grey area ethically. 
- [Biodiversity Heritage Library](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/) is all about collaboratively making biodiversity literature openly available to the world as part of a global biodiversity community.
* [Internet History Sourcebooks Project](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/) — has some great primary source letters from the Leeds mill workers and mill owners that make for a useful exercise because students don't even need to read the contents of the letters to grasp useful information, e.g. that the conflict lasted for _years_ (based just on the dates of the letters).
