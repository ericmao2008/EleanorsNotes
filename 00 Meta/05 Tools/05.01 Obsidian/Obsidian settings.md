You access the settings for Obsidian in to the lower-left corner by clicking the the cog icon, which looks like: ⚙️

This vault has settings optimized for Manifest by default, but you're welcome to change things around. Common things you might want to alter are: 

* Settings > Appearance > change `Dark Mode` to `Light Mode` or increase the font size. For best results, stick with the `Minimal` theme, but you can change the fonts, colors, icons, etc with the `Minimal Theme Settings` plugin, which is already installed. 
* Settings > Hotkeys > change hotkeys to match your preferences, for example to have `create a note in a new pane` be `ctrl+n`  (`cmd` on Mac) instead of `ctrl+shift+n`. 

To learn how to add more plugins for "quality of life" improvements and personalization, check out [this guide](https://thesweetsetup.com/our-favorite-obsidian-plugins/). An example of a plugin that comes down to personal preference is the [Hider plugin](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider), which makes Obsidian feel more like a normal Mac app by hiding the header at the top.
