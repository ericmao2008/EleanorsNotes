At the absolute most granular level, there's vim mode. If you aren't already familiar with [vim](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vim-editor-modes-explained/) now is not the time to become familiar with vim, but if you're already used to terminal editors, be aware that Obsidian supports vim mode in the settings. 

## Lines

For people who aren't familiar with vim (which is the _vast_ majority of people), the next most granular level is the ability to swap lines up or down. 

This vault has `ctrl/cmd+alt+up` and `ctrl/cmd+alt+down` set to move lines up and down respectively. You can also use the command palette to `/move` a line up or down. 

## Sections

It's also possible to move entire sections up and down using the Outline pane. Type `/outline` to toggle it, or click the icon on the right hand side panel that looks like a bullet point outline. Then you can click and drag section headings to move them wherever you'd like them to be.
