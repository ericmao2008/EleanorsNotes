The **graph view** has two modes: 

* **local**  (click the "..." menu at the top right of this panel, then click "open local graph") which is useful for seeing all the connections into and out of a particular note, at a variety of levels "deep." 
* **global** (it's easiest to launch this through the command palette, type `/graph` â€” or you can use the `ctrl/cmd+g` hotkey if you're good at remembering hotkeys) which is useful for getting a broad overview of the wiki's structure and what the more important projects are.
