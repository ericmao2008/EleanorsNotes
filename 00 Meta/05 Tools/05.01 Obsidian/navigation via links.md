**Links** let you jump between files, just like using Wikipedia in a browser. You can follow chains of connections between concepts by clicking the links. 

As with the file explorer, you can `ctrl/cmd+click` to open links in a new pane, or use the `right click` menu as you would on a browser. 

You can also hover over links to see a preview of a particular link. To change the settings for when you can see this preview, go to `settings > plugin options > page preview` and click whichever toggles you prefer. By default, you'll see previews when hovering over links in edit or reading modes.
