## Sovereign of Compromise 

[[Eramepi]]'s sister and heir. She is originally from the city of [[Marna]] and is very probably asexual. Her public refusal to marry [[Sargov]] of [[Keldehss]] was the final straw that led to the [[Siege of Marna]]. 

Valentia is good at figuring out what people need and encouraging compromises, reassuring and comforting people.

=== THE LIE ===
It is always possible to compromise enough for people to work together. 

=== THE TRUTH ===

It isn’t always possible to compromise; sometimes violence is necessary and people need to be forced to do things for the greater good. 

## Aspects 

### CHILDHOOD 

Always lived in her brother [[Eramepi]]'s shadow. Loved him, though, and always felt appreciated by him. She’s a peacemaker whereas he was much more of a scrapper, quick to take offense. 

### ADULTHOOD 

Not being one for conquest, focused on diplomacy and getting everybody to get along; did a lot of the “clean-up” work after [[Eramepi]] got cities to submit. Has worked hard to really forge a coherent empire, but isn’t emotionally invested in forcing things. 

### EMPRESS
When Valentia is the Empress because [[Eramepi]] is dead, she’s having a tough time holding everything together because without the threat represented by her brother’s military might, some of the more fractious generals and city-states want to secede and take over because they don’t think that her part in things matters, they just want the flash. 

== Description ==

=== PHYSICAL ===
Wears a gold diadem and gold earrings. Always wears a cloak (violet robes trimmed in ermine). Delicate features, heavy brows. Small, slender, soft-spoken. Lustrous black hair. 

=== PERSONALITY ===
Believes in compromise. Cares deeply about what others think. Wants what’s best for people. Innate goodness.

Notes:

[ ] Should Valentia be asexual? Barren? Lesbian? What's her succession plan? Adoption? Seems like a good idea (when it comes up later) to push the law about succession not being able to be close consanguity - adoption required. (In a future book, could Valentia wind up deliberately bearing a bastard son of no known paternity so that it's completel "her" child?)
