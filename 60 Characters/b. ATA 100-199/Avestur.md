High Priest of [[The Architect]] from the [[Oruku]] Temple. 

Politically savvy. Loyal to [[Valentia]] and the the [[Lysarian League]] (mostly due to political self-interest) but fairly conservative and traditional. An organized man, neat and tidy down to the precise trim of his graying beard, and it was not his nature to allow piles to grow and gather dust.
