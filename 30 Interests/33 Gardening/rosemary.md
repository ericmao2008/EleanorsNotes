A mature rosemary plant tolerates drastic pruning, even into the woody parts of the stem.  Pruning rosemary will help make a bushier plant. Trim rosemary once blooming has ceased. The general rule for trimming rosemary is not to take more than one-third of the plant at any time and make cuts just above a leaf joint.  
  
## Harvesting

Rosemary is pretty easy to harvest from cuttings and my garden produces more than I could ever need. One of the nice things about rosemary is that you don't really have to dry it, and popping it into the grinder doesn't create as nice of a ground version as dried [[sage]] but it's still better than just the sprigs.
