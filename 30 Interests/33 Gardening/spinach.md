Planting spinach is easy and makes a great companion plant for cabbage, radishes, onions, ==peppers, and tomatoes==.

## Sowing

Sow seeds directly into your garden soil outside—it is not recommended to start spinach seeds indoors, as spinach have delicate roots and don’t do well with transplanting.

Plant spinach seeds about a half to one inch deep in your garden, covering lightly (another half-inch) with soil. If you live in a warmer climate, plant your spinach where it can get partial shade to keep the soil moist and prevent bolting.

## Maintenance 

**Keep it cool**. Spinach grows best when the soil is moist, but does not grow well in hot weather or in a soil temperature over 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Spinach needs plenty of full sun, but to keep the crop from overheating, use shade clothes as crop row covers, or plant warm weather-resistant spinach varieties, like New Zealand spinach or Malabar spinach. Watering regularly can also help keep your vegetable crop cool. Some spinach, depending on the weather, should even be watered twice a day to keep temperatures down.

**Thin the leaves**. Overcrowding can stunt the spinach’s growth. Spinach seedlings that have sprouted two inches (at least two true leaves) should be thinned four to six inches apart to prevent the plant from overcrowding.

## Harvesting

Spinach plants take about six to eight weeks to grow, but their roots are easily damaged, so be careful when harvesting. You can pick off or cut individual leaves, or harvest the entire plant at once.

If picking, remove the outer leaves from the plant every few weeks, allowing the inner leaves time to mature before plucking those as well (unless you want young spinach, where the leaves are more tender). If you prefer to harvest the whole plant, cut the spinach plant by the base. Regardless of your preference, don’t wait too long—the larger the leaves become, the more bitter they taste, so keep that in mind when harvesting spinach.
