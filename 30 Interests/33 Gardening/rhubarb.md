Rhubarb is a popular home grown vegetable. Unlike most vegetables, Rhubarb is a perennial. This means the same plant will return a crop for many years (around 10 to 15 years).

Growing Rhubarb is relatively simple in cool climates. Rhubarb is quite a hardy crop and is able to withstand lack of water. Rhubarb will survive and produce good yields with little tending apart from the application of fertilizer.

Dig the soil to a good depth and introduce a good amount of  organic matter into the soil. Dig the organic matter in a month before planting to allow time for the soil to consolidate.

Rhubarb is best grown from rhubarb crowns rather than growing from seed. Plant Rhubarb in early spring. It requires low temperatures (around 40 deg F) for it to break its winter dormancy and renew growth. 

**Plant the Rhubarb crowns about 10 cm below the soil surface. **The crown bud should be about 5 cm below the soil surface. Any young shoots that exist should just break the soil surface. 

Spacing of the crowns will depend on variety. Around 60-80 cm spacing is right for many varieties such as the popular Victoria.

**Rhubarb will grow well in part shaded areas. Rhubarb does not grow well in high temperatures.**

Avoid positioning in frost pockets.  A severe frost will have a damaging effect on Rhubarb. It may cause the oxalic acid from the leaves to enter the stalks. For this reason you should remove any stalks that have been affected by a hard frost. Place them on the compost heap where they will decompose. The decomposition that occurs in your compost heap breaks down the oxalic acid.
