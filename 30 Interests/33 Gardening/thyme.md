## Hard Rejuvenation – late fall after first frost 

Hard rejuvenation pruning normally take a few years to complete. In late fall, after the first frost, select one-third of the oldest and woodiest stems on your thyme plant. Using sharp, clean shears, cut these stems back by half.  
  
## Light Rejuvenation – after blooming in the summer 

When you trim thyme for light rejuvenation, you are basically ensuring that your thyme plant doesn’t become too woody in the future. In late summer, after the thyme plant has flowered, select the one-third oldest stems on the plant. Using sharp, clean shears, cut these back by two-third. This should be done yearly for the best health of the plant.  

## Shaping – during spring 

In the spring, after new growth has started to appear, take a moment to picture how you would like your thyme plant to look. Keeping that shape in mind, use a sharp, clean pair of shears to trim the thyme plant in that shape. Don’t cut the thyme plant back more than one-third when shaping. If you need to cut back your thyme plant by more than one-third in order to achieve the shape that you would like, only do a one-third cut back each year until the desired shape of the thyme plant is achieved.
