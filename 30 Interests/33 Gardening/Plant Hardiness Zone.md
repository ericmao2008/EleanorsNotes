## Spring

Cole crops like **broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage** can be direct seeded into your garden around February 24, assuming the ground can be worked, but it's better to start them indoors around January 27 and then transplant them into the garden around March 17. Do the same with **lettuce and [[spinach]]**.

Plant **onion starts and potatoes** around February 6. Sow the seeds of **peas** (sugar snap and english) at the same time. If the ground is still frozen, then plant these as soon as the ground thaws.

Do you want to grow **tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants**? Start these indoors around January 27. Then, around April 2 you should start watching the weather forecast and, as soon as no frost is forecast, go ahead and transplant those into the ground.

Now, for all the summer vegetables like **beans, cowpeas, corn, squashes, pumpkins, cucumbers, watermelons, gourds and sunflowers**, you should plant those seeds directly into the ground around April 6, or if your soil is still very cold, once the soil is near 60° F in temperature.

## Fall

Gardening in the fall can be much more challenging than spring planting, because you are in a race to get your crops mature and harvested _before_ the winter frosts begin, around October 31. This means you need to consider how much time each variety needs between planting and picking. Those numbers vary widely between different varieties of the same kinds of plants! Usually the "Days to Harvest" are present on the seed packet.

Most **tomatoes, peppers and eggplants**, for example, require around 100 days to harvest, therefore you'd want to transplant those into the ground around July 23. Anyway, it's important to remember that the numbers in this fall planting guide are only a starting point for you! Good luck and good gardening to you.

Fall is the time to plant **garlic**. Around September 16, take your cloves apart and plant the toes about 3 to 4 inches deep. This may not be accurate! Garlic dates vary wildly around the country. The way to be sure is to use a soil thermometer. When the soil temperature is 60° at a depth of 4 inches, then plant your garlic.

Cole crops like **broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage** can be direct seeded into your garden around August 22, but because of the heat during that time of year, it's better to start them indoors around July 3 and then transplant them into the garden around August 12. Do the same with **lettuce and spinach**.

Sow **peas** directly around August 17.

Now, for all the usual hot weather veggies like **beans, cowpeas, corn, squashes, pumpkins, cucumbers, watermelons, gourds and sunflowers**, you should plant those seeds directly into the ground around July 18.
