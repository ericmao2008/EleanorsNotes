	* [[spinach]] (planted [[2021-03-22]]) is sprouting in the little rows.
	* lemon balm survived the winter and is spreading well despite the oregano
	* pruned the [[thyme]] back a bunch
	* one of the rosemary bushes died. Need to see about propagating them. 
	* Pulled out the dead [[sage]] â€” need to figure out how to propagate sage. 
	* the mint came back like a beautiful carpet, but did not do a totally complete job of weed suppression. Still, I'm pleased with that portion of the garden. 
	* the primary blueberry bush seems to be doing pretty well. 
	* so much parsley! I can't believe it's even in the yard, lol.

* planted [[strawberries]], tomatoes, and peppers. Ghost peppers are in the upper bed, regular peppers in the lower. Some tomatoes are transplanted from under the blackberry bush, some were really leggy and bought at half price, and some (cherokee purple) were regular price. I'm a bit worried that the front half-oval bed is too shallow near the tip for the tomatoes, but we'll see what happens. 
* also planted chamomile and creeping rosemary on the back garden. 
* [[spinach]] harvests are going really well.
