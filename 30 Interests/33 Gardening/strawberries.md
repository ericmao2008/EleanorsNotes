## Strawberries

The plants are low-growing perennials that can be grown successfully in rows, beds or even pots, and make an attractive groundcover when not fruiting.

Runners (or stolons) are the strawberry plant’s device for asexual propagation. They arise from buds at the base of leaves in the crown. As the runners grow away from the original “mother” plant, their nodes root and, where they touch the soil, produce “daughter” plants.

In Maryland, it's recommended to plant the Cavendish variety: Very large, firm fruit with good flavor. Mid-season harvest. Rated very high in Maryland field trials. Should live around 4 years. 

Set out field-grown plants in March or early April when the soil begins to warm. Tissue-cultured plants are grown in a greenhouse and are more cold-sensitive, so plant them only after the last frost date. Trim roots to within 4- to 6-inches of the crown and set plants with half the crown below the soil level (see diagram below) with roots fanned out.

**Flowers are removed the entire first season. This sacrifices early fruit production to encourage strong growth, runner production, and winter survival.**
