I like to have lots of sage in the garden because it's beautiful when it flowers, it's easy to store, people like getting it bagged in gifts, and it's easy to get the leaves off and grind them up.

## Harvesting

To give new foliage time to fully mature, leave 2 months between your last big **harvest** and the first frost of the season.

You can harvest and use both young and mature sage leaves, but baby leaves will have a better flavor. As you harvest, be sure to leave a few stalks alone so that the plant can recover. Limit fall and winter harvesting to allow plants to get ready to come back strong in the spring.  
  
Even if you wonâ€™t be using the leaves of your sage plants, harvest and prune each year to reinvigorate them. Pruning off leaves and stems can help maintain a good shape and prevent the need to replace plants every few years. Without occasional trimming, sage can become very woody and shrubby.
