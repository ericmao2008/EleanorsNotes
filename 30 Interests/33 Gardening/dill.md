Don't plant dill near tomatoes, eggplant, or peppers. It's good to put near asparagus, though. 

Plant dill from seed; they don't transplant from a container well. Sow the seeds directly in the ground from April through May, after all danger of frost has passed. Do not transplant them. They should germinate in 10 to 14 days. Seedlings should be planted Â¾ to 1 inch deep and from 12 to 15 inches apart.

Dill grown outside matures about 90 days after seeding. Although the leaves can be harvested as soon as they are big enough to use, they contain the most flavors if picked before flowering begins. Clip them close to the stem in the early morning or late evening.

Once the flowers form, they will bloom and seed. Cut the seed heads 2 to 3 weeks after bloom. Place the cuttings in paper or plastic bags, and allow them to dry; the seeds will fall off when they are ready.
