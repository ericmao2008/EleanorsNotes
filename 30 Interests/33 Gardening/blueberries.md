## Blueberries
<cite><a href="https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics">UMD</a></cite>

* Blueberries are in the heath family and thrive in acidic soils (pH 4.3 - 5.3) high in organic matter.
* Mulch and irrigation are essential for fast establishment, steady growth, and consistently high yields 
* A mature blueberry plant will produce 6 to 8 pounds (7 to 9 pints) of fruit per year. Harvest begins in June and may continue through mid-September with late varieties. Berries turn blue 3 to 4 days before they attain maximum sweetness and flavor. They should be picked every 7 to 10 days.
*  Remove all flowers from two-year-old plants to encourage root growth and ensure good establishment.
*  Pruning invigorates the plant, forcing essential new growth from the base of the plant. The guiding principle behind blueberry pruning is to constantly renew the older, decreasingly productive canes by cutting them out to force new canes.
*  Plants may need light pruning in February or March. Remove a few of the small branches or twigs in the center of the bush.

### At Maturity (6 years and older)

A healthy plant should be 5- to 7-feet tall and produce 3 to 5 new canes several feet tall yearly. Each spring, select the best two to three new canes to retain and remove some of the oldest canes. (Canes over 1 in. in diameter do not produce the best fruit.) When you fail to remove older branches, the new canes are likely to be willowy and produce only a few berries at the top. Pruning will result in a plant with 12 to 18 canes of varying ages. This is an optimal scenario; many plants will deviate from this ideal. Â 

Also, remove the lowest branches and thin out branches in the center. The lower branches bear fruit that is dirty and difficult to pick; the center branches produce small, poorly colored and late-ripening fruit. Overly long canes with many flower buds may be headed back, but do not try to top canes to stimulate growth.
