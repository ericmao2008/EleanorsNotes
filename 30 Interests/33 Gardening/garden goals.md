A big rain barrel like this where you can attack a hose is something Husband is ok with as long as it's not perforated along the bottom. I would just want some way to tell how much water is inside?

Awesome [[sage]] bush in st michaels from [[2021-04-10 trip to St Michaels]]. It's so big! Like a proper bush! And still gives perfectly fine leaves.
