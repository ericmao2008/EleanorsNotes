The Arais Delta, located to the south of [[Nahrian Basin]] on the Isle of [[Maehlorn]] has only one city, [[Ulmes]]. The swampy delta is riddled with shifting rivers and creeks. Despite its dangers, the marsh has many useful plants and animals, including several varieties of poisonous snakes and frogs. Tough crocodile hides are a popular trade item, along with [[moonfish]] scales, which are known for their purifying properties.

Clothing norms involve the idea that "straight" is bad luck -- so they value asymetrical hems, etc. This has to do with the winding nature of the rivers.
