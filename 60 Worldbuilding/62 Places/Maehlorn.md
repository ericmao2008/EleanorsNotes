### [[Civil Mage|Civil Mage]] Era

The northern portion of the Isle of Maehlorn is dominated by the heavily forested [[Voldshee]] Mountains. Central Maehlorn is dominated by a V-shaped alluvial plain known as [[Nahrian Basin]], while the south-central portion of the island is a swampy hellhole called the [[Arais Delta]] Delta. [[Monche Nomads|Nomadic tribes]] inhabit the central highlands known as the [[Monche Prairie]] and are pressed by the expansion of the Nahrian river valley civilizations, particularly in the west.
