A small town at a crossroads between [[Uskune]] and [[Marna]]. There's a fair amount of logging trade and it's got a historically decent relationship with the [[Monche Nomads]] who they share a border with. The nomads periodically raid and take stuff, but generally not much and it's mostly boys, and the grown-ups usually come by a bit later and trade at what seems like a loss... to sort of make up for the boys' foolishness. Plus, they do a lot of important work to hunt the dangerous animals and keep them away from town. 

Basically, there's an unspoken understanding that is honestly not that different (in the locals' minds) to taxation by the city-state nobles... which leads to conflicts with those nobles because they want to be the only ones taxing Brookside, for financial and control reasons.
