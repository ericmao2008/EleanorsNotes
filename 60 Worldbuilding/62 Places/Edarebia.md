Edarebia is region located to the east of Skiple Bay and west of the [[Arthgaven Mountains]]. 

It's the homeland of the [[Swordwulfen]]; they were created by the mages from the [[Akademe]] who came to power thanks to trading with the [[Eheu Isle]] refugees led by [[Kala]]. The [[Eheuian]] refugees created a settlement on [[Kortien Mountain]] called [[Tulpitown]]. 

For most of history, they were governed by a mage council, as described in [[2021.11.03 The Impossible Knife (SS)]]. The council took in refugees fleeing the [[Cult of Valor]], which is one reason that Edarebia has a high concentration of mages.
