Named for the Polynesian word for "Winged" because it's inhabited by a non-native species of winged humans known as the [[Eheuian|Eheuians]].

An island located off the northern side of [[Maehlorn]], at the northeasternmost point of the [[Braez Strait]], itself northeast of the [[Wasatean Sea]]. The Realmwalker built a settlement the [[Eheuian]] people here in roughly 150 BTA. 

The growing season is pretty short and brutal because of how high in the mountains it is. Most of their lands are above the treeline, although there are some pine forests in the valleys. Pine nuts, [[tulpi]] herders, terracing in some of the valleys (they're not exclusive to Inca. [[Newsletter Ideas]] â€” terrace agriculture). 

The region is primarily comprised of extremely high alpine mountains and some shallow valleys where not much but pines and scrubgrass grow, divide the year between the snowy season and the dry season, with the Typhoon Equinox and the Dry Solstice as the rough time when the seasons shift. The terrain is pretty harsh, but most natural disasters tend to be of the "uncooperative weather" variety (extra-bad blizzards or dry seasons) not the "earthquake/tornado" variety.

The pine trees of Eheu Isle give off incredible clouds of pollen, which is what the [[tulpi]] eat. 

Eheu Isle is the only known source of [[realgar is a poisonous red crystal]].
