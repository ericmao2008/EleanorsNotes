The region between [[Efrenzan]] and [[Cyhlonore]]. Modelled on Germany circa the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]], so the western forest must be pretty thick; geographically it's a hinterland, although the border wavers between the Swanbell River and the mountain range that [[Otskeir]] sits on the pass between.
