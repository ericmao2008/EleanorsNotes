An expansionist cult that enslaves foreign mages in the forms of animals, and subverts their magic so their non-mage priests can access them.

Founded by [[Valor]], an Imazi mage banished from the desert tribes for his warmongering, violent habits. He conquered [[Alliju]] and deified himself, making Alliju the capital of his theocratic empire. 

Their "special ops" espionage arm is known as the [[Lions of Valor]].
