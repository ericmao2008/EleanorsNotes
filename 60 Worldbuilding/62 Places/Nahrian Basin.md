The [[Nahrian People|Nahrian People]] live in a highly fertile basin region on the Island of [[Maehlorn]]. Cities dot the riverbanks, surrounded by farmland. The fields primarily support barley, lentils, beans, melons, grapes, figs, garlic, turnips and onions. There is little animal husbandry beyond goats and sheep for wool and milk, though wild-caught fish and waterfowl are part of the local diet.

Historically, there have been many cities with independent governments that share a religion and language. These cities controlled only enough farmland to support the urban populations and would expand via colonization to form new cities. However, the city-states are basically now out of room to comfortably expand, and wars of consolidation have been common for during the 600s and 700s ATF. 

[[Lysaria]] is one such consolidated state.
