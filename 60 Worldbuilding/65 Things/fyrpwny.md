- [?] seriously what's going on with the fyrpwnies? I want to use them in [[Red Rider]] and they're on the cover of the anthology — [[The Chronicles of Verraine - High Resolution.jpg]]  — because it was an absolutely perfect image, but the silver horses are definitely invented by [[Flavia]] in the collegium era [[Tal]], which I think is after the rise of the [[Swordwulfen]] in the east. It's time to #fic/expandWorldbuilding on the [[Salted Wars]], the [[rorgoten]], and the [[Cult of Valor]].
