magic crystals made out of mage blood that can be used to passively pull power from the aether and refine it at a very slow rate. 

## On Eheu Isle

Originated in [[Eheu Isle]], the winged inhabitants were taught by a Realmwalker because they were meant to create a stockpile for him to use. 

On Eheu Isle, aetherals are created by mining bluestone, taking the flakes, heating and melting them in the cauldron. The heating a melting removes impurities, leaving the aetheral crystals. Adding Eheu blood makes the crystal grow bigger by adding more core ingredients; it's pure compared to the bluestone which is probably contaminated by weather and nature as well as parts of the Eheu that cannot be used for aetheral.  

One of the reasons they bury the corpses in sacred spaces instead of making aetherals straight from the corpses is that the "blood makes the crystals grow faster" is only true of the blood; the decomposition process in the sacred spaces is aided by some magic decomposer beasties that basically help get "every last drop of latent power" out of the bodies (not just the blood) during the process of forming bluestone. The corpse blood is a catalyst for the decomposers, so long term bluestones are still a better choice than bleeding an entire body dry of blood. 

The decomposition process of corpse to harvestable bluesteone takes, like, years

This is one reason there's a taboo against bleeding priestesses; it's short-sighted because it weakens them.  bleeding them is more effective short term but worse long term, sort of like killing the cow to sell the meat instead of keeping her for milk. The other reasons have to do with attempts to limit inter-group violence thru cultural norms. [[The Realmwalker]] really doesn't want his backup battery being rendered useless by civil war.

- [b] Apparently this is mirrored by [Palo monte, an Afro-Cuban religion involving a cauldron hosting the spirit of the dead](https://nomadit.co.uk/conference/sief2011/paper/6650), complete with going to a tomb, taking part of the body, and back to the cauldron. 

## Elsewhere

They're bought in the [[Arais Delta]] and used to fuel the enchantment magic common in Arais. 

It's also what was used to build the tower in [[Temple Mage]]. 

the color varies depending on the power of the inputs; all the [[Eheuian]] ones are blue (they have no strength variance because they were basically genetically engineered).

aetherals are definitely going to be useful as currency at various points and times, along with other things that are useful as currency. In the early days there aren't really enough mages / knowledge of how they work for that to be useful but later on in the series, absolutely. currency similar to the "scales" in the Cradle series.
