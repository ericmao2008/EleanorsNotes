Realmwalking is similar to opening a wormhole in the space-time continuum; you basically put so much power in one place that it distort the "aether layer" and allows for "punching through." This sometimes happens by accident; in Verraine (The Realmwalker is not necessarily from Verraine although he could be) the first "canonical" instance of this is Reginald; in later years when super powerful people "claim" land using a technique invented to basically infuse a particular landscape with aura-filtered-power that lets the mage sense the land and act through it. Their power buts up against the power of other landclaiming people and it kind of forms a ridge? and when you have enough of that, the ridges kind of become flows of power (which can be traveled on in a sort of "rainbow bridge" fast-travel fashion between lands, it's kind of like trains haha), and at the nexus points they become semi-stable portals to other worlds.
