A signum is, in short, a signature spell. Mages can create only one to add it to the collective base of human knowledge â€” once a spell has been invented it is immeasurably easier to master and replicate (this is meant to have some similarities to the invention of the [[2020.12.07 Waterwheels|wheel]], conceptually).

During the [[thaumaturge]] era, people who created a signum were essentially diefied; for example, [[Nahrian Temples]] are composed at least partially of mages who learned the secrets of their signum, along with support personnel and those who are philosophically aligned to the mage's goal. [[The Architect]] and [[The Gardener]] for example taught [[aetherrock]] and vacuum seals to their followers, respectively. 

[[Irella]] does not (yet) have a signum, she's just adapting the aether transmogrification spell she learned from the temple. In [[202 ATA Barrow Mage|book 2]] she might develop one after working with the [[Voldshee]] (necromancy involving the Mallorn tree was a foundational *signum* in their culture) and the [[Monche Nomads]] (whose ability to control and bond with animals is also the result of a signum project). 

By the [[Tal|Tallan]] [[the Collegium of Tal]] era (see: [[Collared Mage|Collared Mage]]), each mage is required to develop a signum as a sort of "graduate" project. Flavia's was the [[2021.02.01 Quicksilver|quicksilver]] horse seen in the [[Hired King]] flash fiction piece, and Arminia is responsible for earthsense / demesne linkages.
