Based on [[2020.11.16 Aerogels|aerogels]] (but less absorbent), aetherrock is a product of transmutation that was discovered by the early Temple of [[The Gardener]], which uses thin aetherrock bubbles to preserve food by creating a vacuum inside the bubble. These brittle bubbles are easily shattered/broken open and are non-toxic, so they're good for food storage. 

They are incredibly light, excellent insulators, conductive, and function essentially by using magic to remove the air from "inside" the material, creating tiny vacuum pockets. Aetherrock is typically a translucent blue hue. 

The Temple of [[The Architect]] pioneered a method to make them less brittle by including elastic "fibers" in the micro-structure, which makes it suitable for large building that would, if build out of contemporary materials, otherwise collapse under their own weight.
