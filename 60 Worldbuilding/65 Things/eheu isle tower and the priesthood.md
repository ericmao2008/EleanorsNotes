Male priests live at the Tower; they are comprised of men who don't marry by the age of twenty, for whatever reason (gay, undesirable, not enough women their age, whatever). They can sleep with whoever they want, especially at festivals (the annual festival is mostly the only time they see women). The Tower functions as sort of a monastery that also does "federal government" style work that benefits the whole island. Because they have no families of their own, and are not bound to a clan and come from all over, they're seen as neutral figures. 

The [[Eheu Isle Assembly]] is held at the Tower and is an opportunity for the priesthood to reinforce its power by dint of their control over all of the arable land; fresh luxury food is one of the perks of priesthood. The priests are aware of the truth behind the [[eheu isle funerary]] rites, which are mostly controlled by the priestesses, who function as a sort of subtle matriarchy; they chose their husbands, who become clan chiefs. 

The door of the tower is big and looks kind of like this: ![[Pasted image 20220331101945.png]]
