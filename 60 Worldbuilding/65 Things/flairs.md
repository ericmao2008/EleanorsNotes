Flairs are like extra senses. Their presence is orthogonal to aura power, although the gifts are in some ways powered by aether, so only mages and people very very close to manifesting an aura (or who might not realize they _could_ manipulate magic) have these abilities. 

## Peers

Royalty, Nobility, the Peerage... all refer to the same thing in Verraine; the inborn talent of a person to **sense the land** around them. Everything within their demesne, they know, from the streams to the leaves on the trees, and know when it is disturbed. They can find the tiniest speck of gold deep in the earth and the smallest swallow's nest in the trees.

Young nobles, during their apprenticeships before the fealty ceremony, sense the land around them in a certain radius dependent on the resonance of the power, but during the fealty ceremony, their senses are linked to a particular demesne, which they are then permitted to rule. They will rule this demesne for the duration of their lives, and if they leave the confines of that demesne, they are cut off from their senses, but any time they are within their demesne, they can sense it in its entirety.

Kings and Queens, however, are another matter entirely, for although they were once simple nobles, magic -- and the right to call upon the power of all their loyal subjects -- gives them the ability to do more than just sense the land. They can actually control it. Not like a sanctuary controls their homes, but it is control nonetheless. They can encourage crops to grow faster, heal scars in the land, wrench minerals from the land with only an exertion of power and will. They can calm or cause an earthquake, bring ice to a springtime stream, and more.

Although they can, by the nature of their compact with their people, sense all of their land, the resolution of their oversight is stronger where they have more levels of underlings overseeing the land. In addition, they can only control the land around them in a radius corresponding to their innate strength.

- A RITTER OR DAME'S RANGE IS APPROXIMATELY A HAMLET
- A LORD'S RANGE IS APPROXIMATELY A VILLAGE AND NEARBY LAND
- A BARON'S RANGE IS THAT OF A TOWN AND NEARBY PASTURAGE
- A COUNT'S RANGE IS A CITY AND ITS SURROUNDING FARMS
- A MARGRAVE CAN SENSE AN ENTIRE COUNTY
- DUKES CAN SENSE APPROXIMATELY A STATE'S WORTH OF LAND
- PRINCES CAN SENSE AN ENTIRE REGION.

## Sanctuaries

A sanctuary's magic is centered around **sensing their home**. Though the two gifts are similar in some ways, unlike with the peerage, it is not the land in particular that speaks to her... it is everything, from the walls to the gardens to the air itself. A sanctuary's home is a pure extension of her will. Where she wants a door to be, one will appear. Roses may bloom out of season. Her glass is never empty. That sort of thing.

In general, a sanctuary can bend the laws of reality within their own domain. The size their domain can be, and how much they can bend these basic laws, depends on their resonance. In addition, the homes of sanctuaries begin to take on the personalities and auras of their owners. It is just a feel or aura beneath the level of the green, but above, there is some sentience -- dog-like at the green, but more like a personal butler at the level of the violet. The autonomy of the home increases with age, not power, at these levels, and in some cases may linger after a sanctuary's death for a period of time dependent on resonance and autonomy.

While most sanctuaries resist moving, and get very attached to their homes, it is possible for one to relocate. This will have a negative effect on any established sentience, however, and require the new home to essentially start from scratch -- unless a sanctuary is moving into a home previously occupied by another sanctuary. This transition is never seamless, but while sometimes a home may take a dislike to another, often it is the case of an apprentice taking over from a master, or a family member taking over from another, and this lineage allows for some continuance and piggybacking of the sentience. It is for this reason that capitol palaces often seem very, very human -- and almost omnipotent.

- CAN EFFORTLESSLY PRODUCE SMALL ITEMS THAT DISAPPEAR ONCE OUTSIDE.
- HOMES LIKE PALACES, BUT FIVE TIMES AS BIG ON THE INSIDE. EFFECTS -- SUCH AS SATIATION -- PROCURED INSIDE LINGER EVEN OUTSIDE.

## Menders

Menders are often considered healers, but since they can **sense bodies** they can also make very effective killers, particularly of the subtle varieties. Some of history's most effective warriors, assassins and spies have been menders, who are able to create targeted, innocuous poisons out of simple compounds only one person at a banquet is allergic to, able to see exactly which muscles have been weakened by exhaustion, etc.

Stronger menders also have advanced healing factors, another reason why menders traditionally make excellent warriors.

## Mesmers

These witches are students of the mind. Many join the priesthoods, while others choose to travel as minstrels or open taverns and houses of rest. Many are nomadic explicitly so they can have a little mental peace, and avoid the troubles that come from people in your town knowing they have no secrets from you.

The earliest mesmers founded the Temple of the [[The Counselor]] in the [[Nahrian Basin]]

Many stronger mesmers are quite mad, as they often can't separate out their thoughts from others' long enough to think.
