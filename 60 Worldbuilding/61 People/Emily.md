- [?] What is Emily's story? Her era? Her narrative purpose? What lens does she offer when seeking information about Verraine and Tal? 
	- Is she before or after [[Arminia]]? Emily's era is a timewhnen the Collegium is independent & not literally enslaving mages, so probably after Arminia manages to get rid of Tallan slavery and push thru some reforms. 
	- But what is happening in her era? the Neo-Valorists, like [[2021.10.27 Poison (MF)]]? 
	- The [[the Collegium of Tal]] exists to protect mages but what do they _do_ in [[Tal]]? The analogy politically is sort of like the Vatican, and I don't want to always be "all infrastructure all the time," but infrastructure building was pretty important to Rome, which Tal is based on. Flavia definitely is known for her messenger-magic, and there's a lot of room for stuff like "makes the rivers flow backwards" kinds of aqueduct magic, and of course Roman conquest â€” what kinds of inventions really _were_ unique to Rome? Something to #research so I can figure out Emily's role in that.
	- Regardless, what is Emily doing? Who _is_ she? What drives her?  She's a spy / political agent in the original conception, so how can I support that with mage powers? Something like the mind-reading mesmer abilities of [[Carmine Mage]], or [[The Counselor]]? 
		- [I] Emily's job is to ensure that the polities surrounding [[the Collegium of Tal]] don't unite. Her mission is to keep local strongmen from arising and conquering â€” the Collegium does not and cannot rule, but will suffer no great powerse to arise. They defend the small polities from any warmomngers on the outskirts, but do so so subtly that invader never realize they are being repulsed. #fic/storyStem 
			- They are basically doing CIA style manipulation and assassination and spying with magic to be a sort of shadow government; it's not real rule, their only mandate is to keep the region safe for mages. They tweak culture as gently as they can and keep a lot of their actions secret even to their own membership â€” who after all might have mundane families or lovers and can't necessarilyb e counted on not to accidentally spill dangerous information. It's all very need  to know, and Emily is one of their top agents, until..... ??? 
				- [n] typically this is presented as bad, but I want to subvert it and go the Shadowsinger route (ðŸ’š Modesitt)
