The internet thinks that this is a Hawaiian name meaning "royal," it's evidently related to the name "Sara." Born into [[Kukihoi clan]]. 

Questions for her character development: 
- [?] why is Kala so devout? 
- [?] why is filial piety so important to Kala? 
- [?] how did duty to [[The Realmwalker]] become such a core part of her personality? 

## Ideas

religious devotion is more important to her than her clan per se because she likes her mom a lot more than her dad, and because being a priestess is the "special" thing that sets her apart from her peers and makes her better than them â€”  it's why boys like her, and she has some deep-seated insecurities about not being "good enough" on her own (i.e. Healani's boyfriend likes her for _her_, Healani is really awesome, could play up that angle some more) so she leans into the things that make her good enough. 

The stories of the Realmwalker give her meaning because the narrative of her parents marriage is not a good or positive one. 

Her beloved brother left her because of the gods rules so she learned early on that the god is more important than family.
