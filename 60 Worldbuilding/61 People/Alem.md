Appears in: [[Civil Mage|Civil Mage]]

A [[biladiyn]] assigned to guard [[Irella]]. His mother is a ranking *biladiyn* officer and he was raised in the organization. [[Irella]] prefers to work with him because he values her emotional health as well as her physical health, and doesn't discriminate or judge her on the basis of her history -- he's not a nativist. 

He has very strong feelings about what the biladiyn are and aren't, and believes in their mission and duty to support the priesthood, and doesn't really care to play the game of Empires.
