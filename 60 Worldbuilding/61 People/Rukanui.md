High Priest of [[Eheu Isle]] during [[(NL) By the Blood of Mountains]]. He's the one responsible for corrupting the [[eheu isle tower and the priesthood]] and selling off all the [[aetherals]]. He's a big man, built like an amphora, with scrawny arms and powerful legs. He's from the [[Kukihoi clan]] and is [[Kala]]'s mother's mother's brother. He has a good relationship with [[Caipan]] and is very misogynistic.
