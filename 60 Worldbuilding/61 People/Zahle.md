## Aspects
### Trouble; 
As a youth, was involved in a [[wyvern]] attack, after which her legs had to be amputated. No longer able to live a nomadic lifestyle, the leader of her tribe apprenticed her to a basket weaver in [[Senna's Ford]]. The tribe paid a handsome apprenticeship fee, along with a sizable dowry.
### Background; 
Grew up on the water. To Zahle, the river is sacred. 
### Big Lie;
Zahle believs that Kia is too young to face adulthood’s rigors and that a mother’s duty is to protect her children from harm.
### Want vs. Need;
Zahle wants Kia to be safe.
