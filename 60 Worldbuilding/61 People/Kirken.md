A priest of the tower. He joins Kala's expedition at the end of [[(NL) By the Blood of Mountains]]. 

Hates [[Mahiai]] because they are from the same birth clan ([[Hanaupo Clan]]). Mahiai got out, but Kirken was scrawny and unimpressive during the festivals. He is, however, great at finding pine cone nuts, but none of the clans saw that about him or cared.
