## The Bureaucrat
Goddess of GOVERNMENT. 
She is the patron of law/justice (judges, lawyers) and social order (police). Mages trained in her temple are truthsayers/lie-detectors and able to perform entrapment.

A common curse in [[Nahrian Basin]] (and therefore [[Lysaria]]) is *demn you* -- short for "condemn you to the Bureacurat's justice."
