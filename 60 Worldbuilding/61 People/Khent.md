### Recurring physical markers 
![[Khent.png|+side -sm]]
Clay in his hair to protect his scalp from the sun. Prominent widow’s peak. Button chin she used to press as a child, he always obliged with a giggle. Vein from his eyebrow to his hairline bulges when he’s stressed. Too skinny for his frame. “unpadded bones.” 

### Recurring personality markers
Willing to make dangerous deals to care for his family; willing to sacrifice. 

## Aspects
### The Big Lie:
Khent begins by believing that all problems can be solved with gumption and a positive attitude. 
<!--### The Ghost

### Wants vs. Needs;
Kent wants his family (daughter [[Kia]], wife [[Zahle]]) to be happy.
