Enduca is one of the [[biladiyn]] assigned to guard [[Irella]] on her journey from the [[Oruku]] to [[Uskune]]. She was born a prostitute's daughter, but had no talents relevant to the Temple her mother served, and was seconded to the *biladiyn,* where she typically guarded Engineers until the events in [[Civil Mage Chapter 01 - Sewers]]

She greatly admires [[Alem]]'s mother, and has a verbal tic where most of her statements are phrased as questions.

-   One of her [[character ideas - verbal tics]] is that she always articulates herself using questions.
