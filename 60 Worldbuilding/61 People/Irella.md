Protagonist of [[Civil Mage|Civil Mage]].

## IMMIGRANT CIVIL ENGINEERING MAGE

Irella can channel magic for much longer than most other [[mages]].  Magic concentrates exponentially, so this is a huge advantage. She has been trained to create infrastructures such as forts, roads, bridges, etc., but her [[Voldshee]] background will also allow her to also perform feats of [[necromancy]] later.

### Arc

#### THE GOAL

Find a place where she belongs and defend it. 

#### THE LIE

She must sublimate her heritage and experiences in order to fit in.

#### THE TRUTH

Her multicultural heritage is an advantage.

### Aspects

#### STOLEN CHILD OF THE VOLDSHEE

At the age of 8, during the unrest surrounding the founding of [[Uskune]], Irella accompanied her parents to the lowlands to sell timber. Their convoy was raided and Irella was taken as a slave, then rescued by the [[Eramepi]]’s forces and taken by the Temple of [[The Architect]] in [[Marna]] to be raised. Irella’s mother’s name was Elixane.

#### VALOROUS WAR PRIESTESS

From age 13 to the beginning of the story (age 23), Irella has served with the armies of [[Lysaria]] as a glass cannon style military engineer, responsible for creating fortifications and infrastructure improvements. She was awarded citizenship from [[Eramepi]] after she stopped a rout by standing firm and creating a fortress for him to retreat to. She wears her citizenship medal as a talisman under her robes; it is gold and struck with an image of his face and hers. She has done her best to make herself into a model Lysarian and bury her barbarian past.

#### USED & ABUSED

The men of [[Lupicin]]'s regiment are hyper-masculine, misogynistic and deeply tribalistic in the sense that they respond poorly to outsiders. They are prejudiced and have made it known that they do not respect Irella, they resent having to defend her in battle, they do not think her talents and abilities are needed by “real” soldiers, and have essentially made it known that they can’t be relied upon. The upper echelons of local leadership have been dismissive of her, partly because of her heritage and partly due to her loyalty to [[Valentia]].

### Description

#### PHYSICAL

Tightly curled black hair. Muscular with “farmer’s hips.” Wide nose. She takes care to always dress smart, professional, and well-groomed so as to present as civilized. Chin round like an egg.

#### PERSONALITY

Irella is very stubborn and brave in the face of physical danger. She is also insecure and hides it by practicing elegance and fashion, choosing to present as a perfect [[Lysaria]]n. She is deeply loyal by nature and takes betrayals badly. She is self-conscious about her height.
