The Temple was founded by [[Tef]], a mesmer. Tef was deified as an agricultural goddess after devoting her life to spreading irrigation and other agricultural techniques throughout the region of her homeland, near [[Lake Tsiya]]. The temple continues these practices and recruits heavily from local mages, who become priests. The temple is a center of learning, and is home to an incredible library recording weather patterns, rainfall, harvest yields, etc.

[[Masi]] was raised as a priest in the Temple.
