The Monche are nomadic, with a strong connection to their [[domestication|domesticated]] animals: horse ([[2020.11.30 Onager|onager]], really), hound and hawk. Monche [[Magic|mages]] have a mental bond with their mounts, and some few are able to prophecy with oracle bones.

They herd [[yhaoginli]] rather than sheep and subsist predominantly on products of mare's milk, spider meat (see: [[Spider Kebab Correspondence]]).
