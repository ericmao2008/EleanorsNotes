<b>1953</b>: Operation AJAX strengthens the power of the Shah and his secret police<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">[2]</a></sup>.

<b>TOGETHER, THEY MADE A BABY.</b>

<b>1970</b>: Dorottya and Samir meet at a ballroom dancing event, fall in love, and marry -- although Dorottya's aggressive embrasure of second-wave feminism<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-wave_feminism">[5]</a></sup> causes some conflicts with his mother. Since Fatimeh is still back home in Iran, Dorottya finds this tolerable. 

<b>1979</b>: Due to the unrest of the Iranian Revolution<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution">[6]</a></sup> and the spread of communism, as well as the foundation of a theocracy, the remainder of the Samir's relatives, beginning with nephews vulnerable to conscription, joins Samir in Detroit. Now formally invested in the United States, the Ashavan coven's reagant -- Samira's grandfather, Amir -- is aghast at the foreign influence that has taken root in his heir, mostly due to the relationship that has been created with the vampires. 

<b>1980</b>: Samira is born, later in life for Dorottya due to her insistence on focusing on her career, quite unusual for the time. She is a biochemical engineer, and also manages the relationship between their small coven and the the local seethe, in order to keep the coven of refugees safe. Her father has established a career as an automotive engineer. Samira therefore has many babysitters, and learns Farsi, English and Hungarian as native languages, though not all of those languages are shared amongst her caretakers, causing confusion and frustration on multiple fronts.

<b>EVENTUALLY SHE GREW UP.</b>

<b>1982</b>: The Safavi family purchases and refurbishes a restaurant in Detroit's Arabic district. It employs many of the older generation of the family, though the younger generation is encouraged to go to school, get their educations, and aggressively succeed by taking advantage of the opportunities in America.

<b>1992</b>: At age 12, Samira is given her first job -- doing dishes in the restaurant after school. There, Samira's nascent ability to control water is noticed by a cousin. Her training begins and she is formally made a member of the coven.

<b>1995</b>: After several years of power struggles, Samir takes over the mantle of reagant and family patriarch when his father dies, though he does not embrace Americanization nearly as much as the older family members feared. Fatimeh focuses her attentions on Samira, who is fifteen and going through a rough time in the American school she has been placed in. Samira, who has a tumultuous relationship with her mother, embraces the attention and is eager to listen to her grandmother's accounts of the family's past glories. 

<b>2000</b>: Samira's father dies unexpectedly young, and her great-uncle Havad, an older man representing the more traditional side of the family, becomes reagent of the Ashavan coven. Dorottya is quietly pressured into leaving, and expects her daughter to join her. She is furious when Samira remains with the coven, but as Samira is 19, there is nothing she can do. Protected by the influence of her grandmother, Samira pursues a business degree. 

<b>BUT ADULTHOOD IS HARD.</b>

<b>2001</b>: Under Havad's leadership, the coven eschews contact with the vampires, and focuses limits its attentions to the Middle Eastern communities that have settled in Detroit. They avoid contact with Americans, even to the point of refusing to market the family restaurant to American sensibilities. All menus are reprinted in Arabic. 

	
<b>2003</b>: Havad attempts to arrange the marriages of several of his nieces, including Samira. Though one of the more traditional girls agrees to the marriage, Samira leads her cousins in refusing. In a show of outright defiance, Samira brings a Chinese date to the family's Nowruz<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowruz">[7]</a></sup> celebrations. The scandal catapults her to the top of her generation's social hierarchy.  

	
<b>2005</b>: When her grandmother dies, Samira is put under increasing pressure to stop being neutral and choose to use either white or black magic, as is appropriate 'for a woman.' In pursuit of independence, she gets a job as a hotel manager and begins learning how intricately intertwined the hotel business is with money laundering. She keeps this information to herself.  

	
<b>STILL, DESTINY HAS A WAY OF FINDING PEOPLE.</b>

	
<b>2010</b>: When Havad dies, Samira and her cousin Joseph compete for control of the coven's remnants. Given their ages, it is likely that whoever is reagent will be so for a long, long time. The factional fights are fierce, but many remember how successful the family was under Samira's parents' control. When things begin to spiral out of control, the coven splits into two. Samira becomes reagant of the Aiqtalae coven, a name that means <i>uprooted</i> in Arabic. Samira purchases a hotel and mends fences with her mother, who has been without a coven in the interim. Re-empowered, Dorottya is able to re-establish her relationship with the Detroit vampire seethe.

<b>2012</b>: Samira begins actively recruiting other witches of eastern European and Asian descent who were displaced by the rise of communism. With careful navigating of immigrant communities, she begins gathering the displaced remnants of old-world covens, many of whom had no idea of their heritage. 

<b>2013</b>: Samira meets a CPA/lawyer named Sebastian and begins dating him. He teaches her a lot of useful paperwork tricks, for example how to launder money for the mob. They have a brutal falling out when he discovers that she and her cousins are witches. 

<b>2015</b>: Samira's relationship with her mother, never the most stable, deteriorates when Samira refuses to allow Dorottya to treat the Russian members of the coven poorly due to their heritage. Though Dorottya remains with the coven, she begins isolating herself. Within the year, she dies of heart failure. 

<b>2016</b>: The vampire council Detroit comes to Detroit, and the Samira's coven helps destroy their allies for their arrogant demands and threats. With little to tie her to Detroit, and plenty of reasons to leave the failing city, Samira brings her coven to the Tri-Cities. She senses opportunities, and plans to purchase a casino in Pasco once the sale of her hotel in Detroit closes.
