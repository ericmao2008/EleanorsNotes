Happy New Year! 

## Small Things

I swapped out the green "branding" color this newsletter uses, so it should be a little easier to read links in dark mode now, at least for the emails. 

I started an account over at [pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social/eleanorkonik), which is a free and open source instagram alternative. It runs off the ActivityPub protocol, which means it also interfaces pretty nicely with [my twitter alternative](https://scholar.social/@eleanorkonik). 

I've mostly been posting old vacation photos, but since this is me, they're mostly things like "check out this cool Roman gate" and "here's a photo of basket weaving in action." 

I updated the [Giants issue](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/giants) to include a couple of awesome links submitted by readers. The Hebrew should be a little more accurate now, too. 

## The History of Food

I got invited to curate an email deep dive into the history of food over at Refind ("The essence of the web, every morning in your inbox"). Refind's thing is that they try to summarize and offer overviews of things you might be interested in. It's about half machine learning algorithms, half hand-curated lists, but it's got tens of thousands of users and I'm super excited by the opportunity they've given me to curate my own deep dive. 

The idea is that food is a critical part of human culture and sits at the heart of many of our most cherished traditions. Understanding how culinary habits evolved in different cultures can help us better understand and appreciate our own.

## Social Signaling: Historical Tips for Worldbuilding Realistic Symbolism

I had an article published in the final issue of Worldbuilding Magazine's 5th volume: _Social Etiquette & Expectations_. It's official title was "Go Ahead, Judge A Book By Its Cover." I changed the name when I mirrored it to my website to be more clear for people who weren't reading the whole magazine and therefore weren't familiar with the theme. The general idea is that I did a deep dive on different ways people throughout history and across the globe use visual signals to communicate with other people. 

It touches on a lot of themes that have come up in the newsletter, including [tattoos](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/tattoos), [sumptuary laws](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/sumptuary-laws/), & [symbols of leadership](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/sea-prince/).

## WorldCon

The World Science Fiction Convention was held about an hour from me this year, so I went. I met a lot of really interesting people and attended some fascinating panels. 

Some highlights included:

- a small group session with Ada Palmer, a history professor at the University of Chicago and author of the truly excellent _Terra Ignota_ series, which just wrapped up. 
- an incredible panel on Hidden Histories, which I [tweeted about](https://twitter.com/EleanorKonik/status/1475127790148022275) in relation to the [Giants issue](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/giants) of this newsletter.
- a wonderful panel centered around imagining what diplomacy might look like in a universe where humanity is spread out between planets but does _not_ have access to faster-than-light technology. The panel included at one former diplomat, the son of a Chilean diplomat, and a State Department employee. 

I took a billion notes and wrote at least one short story in my hotel room immediately afterwards.
