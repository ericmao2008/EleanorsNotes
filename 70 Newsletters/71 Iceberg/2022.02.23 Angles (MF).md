Tyoka had never seen anything so alien as the cities of Zirlyth. Their homes resembled nothing so much as beehives, unnaturally bloated with angles. They crammed entire families into spaces so small he wouldn't have raised chickens inside, much less the eight to twelve children each woman seemed to have.

The amount of magic that went into ensuring the hiveboxes were safe for human habitation beggared his imagination.

Not least of all because their reverence for life began and ended with humans.
