It cost Jiri six years and a toe to build a mockup of the forest. His mage-bolt turned it into slag, but the lizard-skin at the center stayed pristine.

## Analysis

- [I] Something about how much I hate "we have to try" and how sometimes trying to stay safe makes things worse, for example antibiotics resistance and protecting children from everything. 
- [I] Could also do something with immortality / [[2021.12.13 Regeneration]] / the scott alexander stuff. Talk about pop culture like Altered Carbon & vampires.
