# When does it make sense for fantasy hominoids to have tails?

I was working on a story for an outlet that likes to see unusual fantasy races, so I was doing a little bit of research about tails and what they're "for" from an evolutionary perspective, because I kind of hate it when fantasy creatures have random animal bits tacked on without any thought beyond "it would be cool if..." 

## Fun Facts
 
* The faster the cat, the longer the tailâ€”the tail helps them keep their balance. 
* The length of a human's vestigial tail peaks around 1 month after conception. 
* Dogs don't wag their tail when they're alone; it's a communication tool, not an involuntary action. 
* Some species of geckos "throw off" their tails to distract _ants_ from an attack. 
* Some lizards will "double back" to eat their own tails after dropping it, to recover the lost resources. They'll also eat rivals' tails after a fight. 

## Naturally Upright
Bipedal animals like gibbons & great apes, which have a bipedal posture, benefit from not having a tail to get in the way of locomotion. The shoulders' scapula bones being situated in the back allows some bipedal animals to raise their arms and swing from them.

## Underwater Propulsion
Fish use their tails for propulsion underwater, so it makes sense that mermaids have tails instead of legs. It turns out that at least one really influential Oceanographer once sat down and worked out what a real mermaid would have to look (and act) like. Seriously, [read More](https://www.deepseanews.com/2014/06/a-not-so-serious-scientific-treatment-of-mermaids/) this time. %% Which, by the way, would make a good [[Backwards Mapping Fiction]] thing for the Mira Grant mermaid thing. %%

## Fat Storage
Crocodiles use their tails as a fat reserve. So do beavers and skinks. It's a surprisingly common use of the appendage; cosmetic surgeons do something similar with the [Brazilian Butt Lift](https://www.drtimalexander.com/get-a-bigger-butt-using-your-fat/). This discussion about [fat-tailed sheep](https://www.researchgate.net/post/Is_there_any_nutritionally_technique_to_get_rid_of_tail-fat_in_sheep) is fascinating. 

## (non) Lethal Weapon 
The breeze from a large mammal's tail swinging tail is enough to block half of the mosquitos in an area from landing. The tail itself makes a pretty decent fly swatter. Given that mosquitoes are a leading cause of disease in swampy regions, to the point that [mosquito nets represent one of the highest ROI forms of charity in the world](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/malaria/), this is an effective adaptation.
