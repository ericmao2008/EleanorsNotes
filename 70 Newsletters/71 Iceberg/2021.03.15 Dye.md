# Weird Reasons the Ancients Chose Certain Dyes 

Subscriber [Bryan Jenks](https://www.bryanjenks.dev/) reached out to me back in February after my [[2021.02.21 Wool]] to chat about some gloves a friend of his had handmade for him. They did it all the old-fashioned way, from the sheep shearing to the natural dyes, and ever since then I've been paying more attention when I come across information about historic dyes... 

## Fun Facts
 
* The Maya used cinnabar to dye the bones of their dead red before interring them. %% Source: [[2020.09.07 Tombs]] %%
* "Direct" dyes are ones that fix to fibers without needing the help of a mordant like tannin or alum to act as a bond. 
* Although indigo is technically a "direct" dye, more properly it is a "vat" dye, which means it needs to be treated to be soluble. 
* The process of creating a natural dye essentially involves heat + a long soak of dyestuffs, then the water is strained and fibers are applied.  
* [Madder](https://florafiber.live/blog/lets-dye-madder) roots are a popular, cheap source of red & orange dye because the plant requires little care once established. By contrast, [hibiscus is not a popular dye](https://florafiber.live/blog/lets-dye-hibiscus) because the results are variable. Dyemakers usually prefer *consistency*.

## A Dye to Thieve For

## Dye To Trade For
Tyre began manufacturing purple dye from shellfish in the 14th century BCE. It was highly prized because of how hard it was to make, was striking, difficult to manufacture — and resistant to fading. It took 10,000 shellfish to create 1 gram of dye, which is enough to dye the _hem_ of a garment. A cheaper alternative was to overdye a madder red with blue woad.

## Dye to Pray With
The oldest tattoos on record date back more than 5,000 years — it was common even before the Bronze Age to dye one's skin, despite the pain associated with the process. Scholars think Ötzi the Iceman's tattoos were intended to be medicinal in nature; Egyptian women used tattoos for protection during pregnancy and labor.
