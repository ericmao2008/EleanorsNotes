> The [[Civil Mage|book I'm working on]] is set in a [[river valley civilization]], and the [[60 Characters/b. ATA 100-199/Irella|protagonist]] is traveling upstream from one city to another, so I had to do a little research into what travel method would make the most sense for her. 

## Fun Facts

*   Canals allow beasts of burden to pull 50x as much weight as they could pull in a traditional cart on road.
*   In the 1600s, travel by horseboat was widely considered reliable, comfortable and cheap.
*   A horseboat pulled along a canal towpath can go about 7 km/hr, faster than walking and smoother than a coach. 
*   Railroads rendered horseboats largely obsolete, but some still exist as tourist attractions. 
*   Bridges built over horseboat canals needed to be smooth and curved in order to avoid snagging towlines. 

## No Stop, Only Go

Because it is very difficult to stop a narrowboat loaded with cargo, canals built for horseboating often had strapping posts for boatmen to wrap towlines to slow down the boats. \[[Read More](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/YT0xNTM1MzU0NDU4Njg5NTA4Nzk5JmM9azNzMCZiPTQzMzk2MTE0NiZkPWUxbTJnOW8=.khpCgRy8LY4GUcZDpi1biOVc-Xtf0rG95NMsdiCmNiY)\]

## Horse Paddle

In addition to towing narrowboats up and down canals, horses could be used to power the paddle boats that operated as ferries, the horses either circling a post and or walking a treadmill. \[[Read More](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/YT0xNTM1MzU0NDU4Njg5NTA4Nzk5JmM9azNzMCZiPTQzMzk2MTE0OSZkPWQ2djV6MmM=.MzzhmfRuQnxlEchwIetXFvg7-MRptRWpEGABd2NI6Vw)\]

## Upkeep Upriver

Maintenance of canals are required for functional horseboating, including the cutting back of vegetation and dredging of relevant canals. \[[Read More](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/YT0xNTM1MzU0NDU4Njg5NTA4Nzk5JmM9azNzMCZiPTQzMzk2MTE1MiZkPW4ydjhvM2M=.RlvGQLZzyZ3Db1PMFIC9FBfWlKvuNe6cXLPloIy_P6U)\]

## Side Paddles

The [[Roman|Romans]] may have had ships yoking animals to wheels that moved paddles on the sides of boats in lieu of rowers, tho there's little hard evidence. \[[Read More](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/YT0xNTM1MzU0NDU4Njg5NTA4Nzk5JmM9azNzMCZiPTQzMzk2MTE1NSZkPXQ4eThrOXA=.dPWaxKkZ67AoN8g-zPjkl35jT4N9IXZGFNaaarf8dYk)\]
