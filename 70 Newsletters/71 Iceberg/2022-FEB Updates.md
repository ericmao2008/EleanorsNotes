It's the first Friday of February, so that means you get an update from me! I like to do these as a scheduled check-in instead of spamming you with all the neat things that happen to me in a month, but if you prefer following along with my projects in real-time, I'm pretty active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EleanorKonik) these days. 

My big reading project for January was that I finally finished [Perhaps the Stars](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781466858770/perhapsthestars) by Ada Palmer. It's the final book of the _Terra Ignota_ series, and Ada Palmer is an incredibly thought-provoking author with some really complex ideas: in "real life" she's a Renaissance scholar at the History of Chicago. 

## Viral Traffic

The biggest news was that one of my articles ([Yet Another Hot Take on "Folders vs Tags"](https://www.obsidianroundup.org/yet-another-hot-take-on-folders-versus-tags/)) got mentioned by a couple of popular newsletters last month. It wound up hitting the front page of a "social news website" / aggregator — the resultant traffic actually took down my website for a few hours, sorry! I'm back up and running, but as part of that process, I've moved most of the articles that used to live at eleanorkonik.com over to either 

- the Iceberg, for worldbuilding, history & reviews. I tagged them as [articles](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/tag/article/)  and [reviews](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/tag/review) if you want to browse the "new" content — my favorite is this piece on the history of [female judges as rulers](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/female-judges-deborah-andamana/). 
- The Obsidian Roundup, where I write about notetaking & productivity. My most recent article was about how [I dislike the language of apps being a Second Brain](https://www.obsidianroundup.org/ite-not-second-brain/).   

## Lessons on Leadership & Failure

My newsletter drip campaign / deep dive into [the history of food](https://refind.com/EleanorKonik/the-history-of-food) did pretty well, so Refind ([here's an affiliate link](https://refind.com/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=barter&utm_campaign=Mn6vY1aQFu5DtmSrH9P7sg)) invited me to do another one, this time about some lessons we can learn from obscure leaders in history. Less Caesar & George Washington, more Brasidas & Shajar al-Durr. Don't know who they are? [Go find out](https://refind.com/EleanorKonik/lessons-on-leadership-and-failure)! 

## Stories

Here at the Iceberg, I also wrote a bunch! 

This month's flash fiction was [The Magic of Marsh Protection](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/the-magic-of-marsh-protection/), which is about an indigenous protector of the rainforest who fights to keep a dangerous invasive species from destroying his homeland. 

The afterword for [Acumen](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/acumen/) touched on how research into iconoclasm, idolatry, and religious icons supports the underlying complexities of my worldbuilding — the story itself is about the consequences of _not_ creating the sacred idols a particular god commanded his people to make. 

[Stint](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/stint/) continues the storyline about a young mage coming of age in a society that treats mages like crap, and how the bureaucracy that exists to protect her uses tough love to keep her safe. 

Lastly, [Wither](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/wither/) is the first poem published on the Iceberg; it's about a woman's refusal to commit suicide after her abusive husband dies. The afterword explores the role of human sacrifice throughout history. 

## Consultation

In other exciting news, as part of my exploration of my options for employment in the fall — when I'm scheduled to go back into the classroom — I've set up a [Consulting Calendar](https://www.obsidianroundup.org/consult/), and I've already had the opportunity to help a few people optimize their setups for writing, which has been really exciting. 

## Comments

There were some great comments on January issues of the newsletter, especially about [Jewelry](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/jewelry/).
