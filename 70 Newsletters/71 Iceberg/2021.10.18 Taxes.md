# ðŸ“— Unready kings, burnt silos & community kitties

> I'm working on integrating a microfiction story about a smuggler into the worldbuilding for my fantasy universe Verraine, so I had to do a little digging into tax codes in different cultures. 

## Quick Facts
 
* Egyptian Pharaohs taxed cooking oil, which was only allowed to be purchased from the Pharaoh. 
* The [earliest tax records known were from the ancient Mesopotamian city-state of Lagash](https://taxfitness.com.au/Blog/earliest-taxes-ancient-mesopotamia-6000-bc) â€” normally they kept the tax rate pretty low, but in times of crisis it could rise as high as 10%
* Hittite silos filed with grain from taxes represented the enormous wealth of the king â€” as long as they didn't [burn](https://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/article/bronze-age-grain-silo-shows-long-reach-tax-collector). 
* Ancient Assyria had a thriving market economy that relied on [taxing passing merchant caravans](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1455/5420484) in exchange for bridge maintenance and bandit suppression. This is a common model: [West African traders used similar tactics](https://www.peaster.net/cms/lib/TX01000798/Centricity/Domain/359/Ch.1Sec.3.pdf). 
*   The elites in the Aztec city of Teotihuacan preferred to [collect surplus by taxation and tribute](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20170198), instead of exerting direct control over the labor force, because it reduced administrative overhead. 

## Labor Tax

The Inca and Maya collected "taxes" by periodically calling up [corvÃ©e](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/corv%C3%A9e) labor forces. The feudal European system was very similar and evolved from the Roman Empire's corvÃ©e system, in which tenant farmers and former slaves owed unpaid labor to the local estates. These labor "taxes" are often used for infrastructure projects and road repairs. 

## Land Tax

The English land tax ("geld") started out around 990 CE as tribute money paid to Viking invaders ("gafol" and then later "Danegeld") before Ã†thelred the Unready ([what a name!](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ethelred-the-Unready)) turned it into an annual tax used to [pay for a standing Scandaniavian fleet](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:4662f8e7-64a9-4347-86f5-4636d27edf1b). Eventually, the kings of England used this tax collection method ("heregeld" or "army-tax") to fund standing armies. It was [surprisingly efficient for its era](http://www.historymatters.group.shef.ac.uk/tax-2013-1013-anglo-saxon-state/). 

## Food Tax

One of the major advantages of collecting taxes in the form of surplus food is that when there's a famine due to bad weather or crop failure, government officials can empty the food stores to feed the hungry. Taxation at its best functions as a [community kitty](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/kitty)

## Subjugation Tax

During Athens' "Empire" period, [its citizens didn't really pay taxes]( https://eidolon.pub/we-condone-it-by-our-silence-bea76fb59b21). The city's government got its income from its allies in the empire and  immigrants in the city. Their taxes funded the public assembly, juries, and public festivals.
