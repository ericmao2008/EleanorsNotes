> I'm a big fan of Tanya Huff's _Confederation_ series. _The Better Part of Valor_ is one of the few books that my husband and I both enjoy, and I was delighted to learn that it was based on real history â€” specifically, the Battle of Roarke's Drift. But history has _lots_ of "impossible defense" last stands, so I went looking for more examples to use as inspiration, since it's pretty hard to write epic fantasy without at least one big epic battle.
