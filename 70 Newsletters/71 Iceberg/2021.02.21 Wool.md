# Beyond Shearing Sheep: Weird Ways To Get Wool ðŸŽ“

I've been working on an [[Creature Creation for the Textiles Of|article about fiber-producing animals that can be used as inspiration for worldbuilding]] â€” for example the fictional nightsheep developed by L. E. Modesitt Jr. in theÂ  _[Corean Chronicles](https://us.macmillan.com/series/coreanchronicles/),_ which eat crystalline cactus and produce coats that can be processed into a cloth known as nightsilk.Â 

## Fun Facts

-   Cashmere is made from the soft undercoat of cashmere and pashima goats.
-   Although some goats are shorn like sheep, higher quality wool is combed out during moulting.  
-   Angora fibers, which are actually hollow, comes from angora rabbits, whereas mohair comes from Angora goats.  
-   Lambswool is known as "virgin wool" because it's taken from a baby sheep's first shearing.  
-   The Inuktitut word "qiviut" refers to either the inner wool of a muskox or the down feather of birds.

## Wooly Lard Pigs

Mangalica pigs were bred for a high lard content, but they also have a lot of curly hair, which creates a fleece that can be either black or red but is usually blond. They look like sheep until you see their faces. \[[Read More](https://www.dartagnan.com/mangalica-pig-heritage-pork.html)\]

## Roo The Baa

Some "primitive" breeds of sheep shed their wool in late winter or spring, so instead of being sheared, they are "plucked" like a turkey to get their fleece off. This process is known as rooing. \[[Read More](https://www.foggyhollowranch.com/processing-fleece)\]

## Meaty Sheep

Sheep were domesticated circa 8000 BCE in eastern Anatolia and western Iran as a captive source of meat; it wasn't for another 4000 years before their wool undercoats got long enough to be usable. [[The Horse The Wheel And Language by David Anthony | Read More]]
