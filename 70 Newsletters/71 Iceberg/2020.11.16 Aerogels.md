>While working on the [[Magic]] system for [[Civil Mage|Civil Mage]], which I recently described as "a screed about the importance of basic infrastructure reform and the evils of NIMBYism," my husband suggested I base the magic material off of aerogels, which necessitated quite a lot of interesting research. 

## Fun Facts

![[aerogel-on-dandelion.bmp|-sm-right]]

-   Aerogel is a synthetic material that is solid to the touch, although it's mostly air with only about 1% microporous silica. 
-   Silica aerogels are light, porous foams with extremely low density and thermal conductivity.
-   Because silica aerogels are typically quite brittle, they are usually reinforced with fibers for large-scale applications.
-   Aerogel is translucent enough to let visible light through while blocking harmful radiation.
-   It's possible to make carbon aerogels out of the biomass waste from jackfruit and durian.

## The Process

![[aerogel-block.png|-sm-left]] Silica aerogels are the lightest type of solid in the world, but aerogels can be made out of eggs and rubber, too. It's even possible to make them at home (although it's very difficult). \[[Read More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wsZf8xIJRA)\]

## 3D Printing

Aerogels can be printed in a variety of configurations, which allows for thermal insulation of even small electronics parts, or the creation of beautiful, light, translucent artwork. \[[Read More]([Aerogel: The micro structural material of the future](https://phys.org/news/2020-08-aerogel-micro-material-future.html))\]

## In Space

Because they're so light, aerogels are incredibly useful for insulating things in space, and upon re-entry into atmosphere. Polymer-based aerogels are even flexible enough to create a film over space suits. \[[Read More](https://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/features/aerogels.html)\]

## Water Ways

Hierarchically structured aerogels can use capillary action to push dirty water upwards for the sun to evaporate, producing steam that can be siphoned off as fresh, clean potable water. \[[Read More](https://phys.org/news/2019-07-antigravity-trees.html)\] %%use this for [[All the Things That Trees Can Be]] because this sort of cleaning water is a useful use of trees -- iirc this link goes to a thing about how this use of aerogels was inspired by plants in the first place. %%

Most **aerogel** blankets, particles, and monoliths are based on silica **aerogel**, which is comprised of synthetic amorphous silica. As a substance, synthetic amorphous silica has been found to not be harmful to humans—it is non-toxic and non-carcinogenic. [Source](https://expandusceramics.com/qa/can-you-eat-aerogel.html)
