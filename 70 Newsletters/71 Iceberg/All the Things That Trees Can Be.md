## In Cosmology 

The world tree is a vital part of the cosmology of many cultures. Typically, its branches extend into the heavens, its roots provide passage to the underworld, and the trunk allows for travel between the mortal realms and the realms beyond. The Hungarian *világfa* permits shamans to climb into the layers of the sky, into heaven and hell; its branches house the sun and the moon. The sacred asvattha is described in Hindu scripture as eternal, its roots upwards, its branches downwards, having neither beginning nor end. World trees play an important role in Mesoamerican cosmology and are depicted extensively in Mesoamerican art. Northern Asia, too, has its own myriad of world tree myths. 

Throughout human history, throughout the world, trees have been sacred, and central to our understanding of the world. The World Tree. The Tree of Life. The Tree of Knowledge. Warden trees. Wish-fulfilling trees. 

Although most of the advancement of Western Civilization has involved clearing trees rather than cultivating them, trees and their products have been as important as stone or metal throughout human history. Wood rarely makes is way into the archaeological record, but humanity would have had a difficult time advancing without trees. Timber for building homes and ships, fruits and nuts to feed us, even the oxygen we breathe comes to us via trees. 

No wonder forests have captured our imaginations for millennia. From the sacred groves of the Celts to Tolkien’s elves, Phoenician cedar to the Black Forest of the Brother’s Grimm, trees play an enormous role in real-life cosmology. 

## In Fiction  

Yet our truly fantastic fiction rarely reflects that. Discworld rests on the back of a turtle, and even Marvel’s *Thor* concerns itself more with the Bifröst Bridge than *Yggdrasil*. 

When creating a secondary world, whatever genre, there are two main paths to take. The first mirrors Anne McCaffrey's Pern, with its complex ecosystem replete with all manner of invented organisms, from painkilling juices to empathic lizards to ravenous fungi. Although the dragons of Pern are of course a key component of the storytelling of Pern, they are not a part of the food web that defines needlethorns or dolphins. L. E. Modesitt typically takes this approach, the sentient, magical soarers of the *Corean Chronicles* largely unconnected to the herder's nightsheep or military's pteridons. Works modeled off of folklore and myth, such as the *Garret, P.I.* series by Glen Cook, often go this route. Ditto riffs off of tabletop gaming, like *Nightseer* by Laurell K. Hamilton or most works by *T. Kingfisher.* 

The other, more common — less complicated — method, is to center worldbuilding around one primary component. In the case of Dune its sandworms, spice and indeed the planet's extreme desertification being a result of the sandworm lifecycle. Robin Hobb's dragons were critical to every aspect of the ecosystem of the *Liveship Traders* series: from the acid-waters to the ship's timbers themselves, everything traces back to the dragons. 

## When Worldbuilding 

Imagine a tree as firmly integrated into a world as the great reptiles that more commonly capture our imaginations. The Celts had their sacred groves; though this sort of reverence is often associated with elves in fantasy fiction, from Tolkien's Lothlorien to the *oak and ash* invoked by Seanan McGuire's October Daye, authors need not feel so limited. 

Most people know that trees (like all plants capable of photosynthesis) function as air purifiers, taking in carbon dioxide and outputting oxygen. Dyson trees and their ilk have been a staple of space-based science fiction as a way to facilitate asteroid habitats and generation ships for decades. In the same vein, trees provide vital access to heat in pre-industrial societies, via combustion and burning. But trees can actually do so much more than that: the Middle Eastern tamarisk tree functions as a natural air conditioner, cooling the air around it not just by shade, but by secreting salt during the day that then absorbs water from the air overnight. As the water evaporates, the surrounding air cools. 

Of course trees provide food as well as air; apples, oranges, dates, walnuts, olives, and coconuts are all well-known examples of produce. But reality takes things a step farther: acorns are readily ground into usable flour, no wheat needed, and the sap of palm trees is self-fermenting, resulting in a tasty wine that is very popular but unfortunately not shelf-stable enough to be enjoyed by most of the west. Yet sassafras teas and root beers are also tree products that could be enjoyed in lieu of the teas and coffees that typically appear in fiction. 

From a liquids perspective, trees are also able to purify water in a variety of ways. The image of a stranded seafarer surviving off of coconut milk is iconic, but modern aerogels take their inspiration from trees when they use capillary action to push dirty water upwards for the sun to evaporate, producing steam that can be siphoned off as fresh, clean, potable water in emergency situations. 

Speaking of emergencies, despite our modern biases, trees provide an excellent building material. Popular in Japan because of its earthquake resistance, with treatment wood is incredibly long-lasting, and cedar was a vital shipbuilding material for millennia. <aside>For an excellent example of how timber trade can be used to kick off an entire plot, see The Raven Tower by Ann Leckie.</aside> It needn't just be elves who make their homes in trees; the protagonists of the long-running webcomic Kevin & Kell live in enormous trees as well. Redwood trees, enormous enough to dwarf even the largest of humans, prove that it is possible for trees to make viable bridges (whether in their capacity as a inter-dimensional world tree or not!) and even span roads. The possibilities are endless. <aside>this is a good place for a photo of a redwood over a road</aside>

Tree-based clothes aren't just reserve for *the Lorax,* either — nor exclusive to the metaphorical fig leaf of Biblical Eden. The people of Niger-Congo region of Africa have been making cloth out of bark for thousands of years; though it pre-dates weaving it is still worn in Uganda and, when left undyed, has a beautiful terracotta hue[^barkcloth]. Chinese silk would have been an impossibility without mulberry trees, and nuts like walnuts and acorns are incredibly useful for tanning leather and dyeing cloth[^nutdyes]. The oils of trees like cedar can be used to preserve textiles, as well, acting as a repellent to insects who might otherwise destroy natural cloths.

But what about the magic? In some versions of lore, vampires can only be killed with wooden stakes — occasionally, only stakes of a particular type of wood. Dryads and other spirits sometimes inhabit trees, either symbiotically or as a single being. Sentient trees, ranging in intelligence from telepathic trees of *Avatar's* Pandora (which leverage recent research[^telepathicplants] into plant communication) to Tolkien's ents to Groot of *Guardians of the Galaxy*  fame, riff off of this mythological trope. Folklore also brings us trees, like the Juniper Tree[^junipertree], that house the spirits of the dead and allow them a "body" from which to act. Naomi Novik uses this device to great effect in _Spinning Silver_.

Trees, being biological constructs, are effective biological agents. Narcotic effects are common, for example the  G'Quan Eth of Babylon 5 or Pern's fellis juice; obvious expansions on folk remedies like willowbark tea. Larry Niven takes the idea of *tree-as-medicine* an enormous leap forward in his *Known Space* series, though — the Tree-of-Life (actually a bush resembling a yam) houses a symbiotic virus that triggers incredible metamorphosis in hominids, making them stronger, smarter, and functionally immortal[^tree-of-life]. Niven's *Ringworld* also brings us "slaver sunflowers," which function as solar-powered lasers able to target intruders with powerful beams of light, similar to the fire flowers faced by the *Mario Bros.*

Trees make for great obstacles in storytelling. The Whomping Willow of Hogwarts was able to trap Remus Lupin in his werewolf state, and served as a guard of an important secret passage into the nearby town of Hogsmeade.  Even without adding fiction to the mix of science, wildfires are an incredible danger, as shown by Janet Kagan's *Mirabille* — but *Hyperion's* Tesla Trees take it a step farther, accumulating enormous amounts of electric charge in their onion-like bulbs, which they can then discharge into the Flame Forests. 

## Put It All Together

Imagine a fantastical tree, central to a created culture, that can do it all: facilitate travel between communities and dimensions, house and clothe its caretakers, purify their air and water, offer food and drink, danger and salvation, inspiration and comfort.  Such a tree would doubtless play a key role in the cosmology of such a people, whether it be large or tall, deciduous or winter-green, jealous of its space or cloned and grove-born. 

# Use the following to create an infographic 

## Travel
* world trees
* bridges
* "beanstalk" (fairy tale and also Heinlein). 
## Air
* purification 
* heating and combustion
* cooling via shade and water mechanisms (see: tamarisk trees)

## Food & Drink
* Palm wine naturally ferments. 
* Fruits and nuts (coconut, dates, walnuts, etc)

* Water purification (fruit and coconut in a pinch if there are no other freshwater sources) -- ref aerogels 
## Spirits & Sentient
* Telepathic mycenaeum trees, eg in Avatar movie. 
* Dryad's / spirits inside. 
* The spirit of a dead parent, eg fairy tales and fairy tale retellings (juniper tree, isn't there an Ursula Vernon story along those lines? Maybe ask Twitter.)
* Ents are sentient living trees , like groot
* Elves often have a mystical relationship with trees. 
## Building

* Medicinal, eg narcotic effects of G'Quan Eth, but also just willow bark tea and such. Fellis in Perm? There was a bark I think. 
* Or wooden stakes to kill vampires. 
## Obstacles
