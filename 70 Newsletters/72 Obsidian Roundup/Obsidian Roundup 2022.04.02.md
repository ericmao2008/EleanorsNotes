## In The Community

* Here's a really lovely [thread for sharing appreciation for the developers of Obsidian](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/lets-show-erica-and-shida-some-love/34704). 
* Nick Milo and I caught up live; you can watch the recording of us sharing updates to our workflows over on Youtube. Mostly we talked about [quick notes & cognitive scaffolding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IL0wFUT6XQ). 
* This wasn't an April Fool's joke, but as far as bugs go, it was [oddly charming](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/tpxk45/obsidian_annoying_sound/). 
* Here's the [April Fool's joke](https://obsidian.md/cloud). (And last April's [quiz](https://obsidian.md/quiz), which is now a lot harder than it used to be). 

### Hub

_The Obsidian Hub is a community knowledge base designed to help organize information about the Obsidian ecosystem. It's an excellent companion to this Roundup, which tends to be very chronological in nature. Here are some of the [recent updates](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-hub/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+sort%3Aupdated-desc+-label%3A%22scripted+update%22+-label%3A%22hub+tools+%26+scripts%22+%3E+)_: 

- The last 3 months or so of [the Obsidian Roundup](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/01+-+Community/Obsidian+Roundup/%F0%9F%97%82%EF%B8%8F+Obsidian+Roundup) have been indexed in the Hub thanks to the herculean efforts of Luke & Claire. 
- Here's a list of [plugins that could use help from the community](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/01+-+Community/Contributing+to+the+Community/Plugins+seeking+help). 
- There's a new index of [plugins useful for collaboration](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/02+-+Community+Expansions/02.01+Plugins+by+Category/Plugins+for+collaboration). 

## Obsidian Updates

Obsidian now offers [40% off education and non-profit discounts](https://help.obsidian.md/Student+and+non-profit+discount) for Obsidian Sync and Publish. 

From [Insider 0.14.3](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v0-14-3-insider-build/34806) & [0.14.4](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v0-14-4-insider-build/35026)

- You can now move, rename or locate your vaults directly from the vault switcher.
- The local help vault has been replaced with a sandbox vault; there's also a new in-app help page with links to the online help docs, Discord, forum.
- You can now set the font for the interface and the editor directly under appearance settings. Note that some themes may override this font setting.
-  Vim mode up/down now goes into rendered code blocks, embeds, callouts, or tables in Live Preview instead of skipping them.
- Pasting and dropping images or media files that are already located in the vault will now link to it directly instead of duplicating the file.
- Obsidian Sync now has a fully customizable sync folder exclusion system. This allows you to add exclusions to folders even if they donâ€™t exist locally.
- Toggle bold/italics will now smartly skip over the closing markers when at the end of the block, instead of adding more marker symbols.

## Plugin News

### Pending (as of Friday morning)

_Note: Not all new plugins are available in the community list yet, as they need to go through code review first. You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat). Note, though, that this is not as safe as waiting for them to go through code review._

- [Text Toolbar](https://github.com/farux/obsidian-text-toolbar) by `@farux`  is customizable toolbar that allows CSS snippets, markdowns, and built-in macros to be applied to selected text.

## Housekeeping

Next week, I'm going to be increasing the price of the Iceberg from $2/mo to $3/mo. If you've ever been curious about what my vault looks like when it's actually in Obsidian, instead of just poking around the public published versions, now's a good time. The `.zip` version ships with my stories and worldbuilding notes, which just got a big overhaul to be a lot more clearer and comprehensive.
