	- purpose:: honestly I had this in my notes as something I wanted to say and hated to waste the verbiage, so I went ahead and turned it into a [twitter thread](https://typefully.com/EleanorKonik/HhUXuqG). 

Software like Obsidian or Mediawiki or Scrivener or VS Code or whatever can be overwhelming at first, even when there isn't much of a learning curve. Most of us find software one of three ways — word of mouth, an advertisement, or as the result of an active search. 

With word of mouth, we'll often hear about some super cool useful thing somebody did to utilize software in an amazing way. The friend who introduced me to Obsidian led with "people are using git to version control their novels! It makes it so easy to explore different branches of how a story could turn out, and then roll back if it doesn't work out." 

I had no idea what git was, but it sounded really cool! 

I poked around the forums some, downloaded the app and tried to figure it out, but couldn't quite make heads or tails of how to use it for worldbuilding notes and writing, which is what I was looking to do. I shrugged and went back to Scrivener and focused on writing. 

I didn't do a great job of keeping track of my research, though I'd started a newsletter to help me organize the top-level important stuff I'd dug into each week, which helped. It felt weird to be using email for my note retrieval, but whatever, it worked. What didn't work was the Scrivener beta. It was ages behind its projected launch date, and the way it handled licensing was that I had to go through the reinstallation process every couple of weeks — it felt like I was reinstalling Scrivener every time I sat down to write, which really meant that every time I sat down to write, I got distracted during the loading screen. 

Eventually I couldn't take it anymore and started looking seriously elsewhere. I had lifetime access to Novlr, and I tried out some of the other cloud-based word processors, but none of them ever really felt right. The interfaces always felt limited compared to what I was used to and and I couldn't opt out of updates I didn't like. 

So I found myself looking at Obsidian again. 

My problem wasn't so much that the Obsidian was complicated as the fact that I was coming in sideways; most of the people in my circles were using paid, cloud based worldbuilding software like LegendKeeper or Campfire or WorldAnvil. The only decent free locally-hosted options were wiki-based, and after struggling with Mediawiki's limitations (and plugin documentation) I knew that wasn't what I wanted either. 

But every now and then I'd get frustrated with something with the product I was using — not being able to access my notes when I had crappy wifi at the gym, weird footnotes, struggling to export my data — and find myself looking at Obsidian again. 

Eventually I wound up in the Discord, asking questions about what was possible, and just dove in and "went for it." It wasn't perfect, but with the plugin ecosystem, at least there was hope I could eventually get the functionality I wanted, and most importantly, once I started messing around with it, Obsidian made _sense_ to me. 

I had been using a markdown-based word processor called WriteMonkey2 for close to a decade, and Obsidian worked perfectly with it. I liked being able to keep my metadata in plain text, instead of having to use a GUI interface and complicated stuff in the file menu to render the views I wanted. Most importantly, I liked that Obsidian didn't do anything weird behind the scenes in my file system — no complicated series of folders creating databases I didn't understand. 

So I asked a bunch of questions, and when I saw people asking questions I had seen others answer I tried to help out, and after about a month of that, the developers asked me to be a moderator. So here I am, trying to give back to the community that gave me so much.
