## In The Community

* The Obsidian Discord now has a `#task-management` channel. 
* [The Art and Craft of Systems Change: Practical Tools for a Complex World](https://www.worldwildlife.org/projects/the-art-and-craft-of-systems-change), a book co-authored by moderator Ryan J. A. Murphy, came out this week. 

## Obsidian Updates

[v0.14.6](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v0-14-6/35640) requires an installer update, but should fix the issue with PDFs. You can now add folders to an ignore filter, there's an improved spellcheck handling of text styling, and more. 

## Plugin News

### New in Community Plugins

### Pending (as of Friday morning)

_Note: Not all new plugins are available in the community list yet, as they need to go through code review first. You can manually install most plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat). Note, though, that this is not as safe as waiting for them to go through code review._

### Updates

 _If you want a comprehensive list of what plugins updated this week, check out this [plugin updates index](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/updates) by Ganessh Kumar._

* [Multi Column Markdown](https://github.com/ckRobinson/multi-column-markdown/releases) has improved support for PDFs now. 
* [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) now allows users to "freeze" updates of a plugin to a particular version. 
* Obsidian Chat View [v1.1.0](https://github.com/adifyr/obsidian-chat-view/releases/tag/1.1.0) allows users to customize headers a lot more.  
* Hover Editor got a bunch of updates. We're up to [0.8.7](https://github.com/nothingislost/obsidian-hover-editor/releases) and it works on mobile, has a bunch of new commands (like converting a pane to a hover instance!), a new keyboard shortcut for the Quick Switcher, and more. 
* The [Another Quick Switcher](https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/obsidian-another-quick-switcher/releases/tag/4.9.0) plugin also has support for Hover Editor hotkeys. 
* [Memos 1.9.0](https://github.com/Quorafind/Obsidian-Memos/releases/tag/1.9.0) allows for commenting, better integration with Dataview and the Natural Language Dates plugin, and more. 
* [Advanced Slides](https://github.com/MSzturc/obsidian-advanced-slides/releases) improved callout support. 
* [Breadcrumbs](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/releases) is having some functionality removed in order to streamline the settings and make development easier. 
* [Privacy Glasses](https://github.com/jillalberts/privacy-glasses/releases) now supports Live Preview. 
* [Tasks](https://github.com/schemar/obsidian-tasks/releases) now supports block quotes. 
* The [Auto Note Mover](https://github.com/farux/obsidian-auto-note-mover/releases) now supports filtering with regular expressions. 

### Betas

_Note: these plugins have not yet been submitted for code review, and are being made available primarily for testing purposes._

* [Omnisearch](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch) now has in-file search. 
* [BD Folder](https://github.com/RafaelGB/obsidian-bd-folder) allows for notion-like databases based on folders. You can edit the cells directly in the tables, new columns, etc and it'll get saved in the relevant note.  It even has filters! 
* Development on the [Dataview beta](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview/releases) continues; there's improved task selection and counts in the headers. 

### For Developers

* Apparently the [iOS dev tools plugin debugger](https://github.com/KjellConnelly/obsidian-dev-tools) plugin thing no longer works; does anybody have a usable fork or know more about it? 
* The obsidian community lib v2.0.0 got a breaking change. If you use this, [go find out more](https://obsidian-community.github.io/obsidian-community-lib/modules.html) because I don't understand the nature of the `app` passing change well enough to explain it but the dev presumably does. 
* If your theme is Obsidian Publish compatible, you can update the json file to add `"publish": true` to your theme info, and also add a `publish.css` file at the root of your repository, along with `obsidian.css`. In future versions the developers will (1) make it easy for Publish users to use the compatible themes for their sites, reducing confusion and loading unnecessary resources, and (2) make it easy for developers to test out their themes on a publish site. Here's [more about why](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/publish-obsidian-app-css-should-not-be-recommended-for-use-in-publish-sites/32467). 
* You can now do `applyCss` and `applyCssByLink` to test out your CSS on Obsidian Publish sites, so that you don't actually need to own sites to test your `publish.css`. The first method takes a CSS string, you can use backtick (template strings) for multiline CSS. The second method takes a link and loads the CSS â€” Silver recommends using GitHub raw file URLs. Here's [an example](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/931552763467411487/966883640569106513) and more information in Discord. 

## Feature Requests

* Should the `Strict Line Break` setting affect callouts? [Discuss](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/should-strict-line-break-setting-affect-callouts/35541)! 
* How can we [improve filtering in the local graph](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/improved-filtering-of-local-graph/35937/3)? 
* [Improved tag handling](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/functional-tag-pane/13794/2) would be nice, especially in terms of creation and deletion of tags. 

## Appearance

- [Mado 11](https://github.com/hydescarf/Obsidian-Theme-Mado-11) by `@hydescarf`  is a neat new theme inspired by the Windows 11 UI styling.
- [LYT Mode](https://github.com/nickmilo/LYT-Mode/releases/tag/v.1.2) now supports Alternative Checkboxes and Hover Editor, and has prettier highlights. 
- [Willemstad X v0.4.3 Nyhavn](https://github.com/tingmelvin/willemstad-x/releases/tag/v0.4.3) got some improvement to the Publish and print css, contrast improvements, and more.
