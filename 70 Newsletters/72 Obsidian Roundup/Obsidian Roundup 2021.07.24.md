- [i] Intended for publication with [[Obsidian Roundup]]

## In The Community

* There’ll be a community showcase for themes, plugins & snippets this Saturday 24th (today!) at 17:00 (CET) (about 4 hours after the roundup arrives in your inbox). It will kick off with `@SkepticMystic`’s breadcrumbs and `@SlRvb`’s snippets! To sign up for a timeslot, use [this form](https://forms.gle/GjCnroTx7roCdhuq6). 
## Obsidian Updates

## Plugin News

### New
* There’s a new [advanced mobile toolbar](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-advanced-toolbar) plugin. It lets the toolbar always be visible and show two rows at the same time. Probably handy for tablets! 
* You can now get [rich links](https://github.com/dhamaniasad/obsidian-rich-links) / link cards in Obsidian! 
* You can [garble text](https://github.com/kurakart/garble-text) using the command palette now. 
* You can [access the spellcheck menu from the keyboard](https://github.com/zapthedingbat/obsidian-keyboard-context-menu-fix-plugin) now. 
* You can [define a “Home” note for startup](https://github.com/mirnovov/obsidian-homepage). 
### Updates
* The lead developer of the Dictionary API is not a member of the Obsidian community, but if you are using the [Dictionary plugin](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-dictionary), you are using his work—and he needs help! The API is not free to maintain and it’s costs a bunch of money in AWS bills, so if you’re a frequent user, please consider [donating](https://github.com/meetDeveloper/freeDictionaryAPI).
* [QuickAdd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) updated 3 times and now has a nicer mobile interface, support for inline JavaScript execution, and a bunch of new macro commands. Most importantly, `@Christian` is working on a video guide so if you have questions about (or requests for) QuickAdd please [fill out this survey](https://forms.gle/6dAit3XKjVrcrxxS8). 
* [Dice Roller 5.0.0](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller) has support for rolling random blocks of notes.
* [Breadcrumbs](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs) can now generate an index for you.
* The [status bar pomodoro plugin](https://github.com/kzhovn/statusbar-pomo-obsidian) can now log completed pomos. 
* [Obsidian Filename Heading Sync](https://github.com/dvcrn/obsidian-filename-heading-sync/issues/18) is back and better than ever! 
* Leaflet is now mobile compatible! Here’s an [example of how cool it looks](http://discordapp.com/channels/686053708261228577/805952223124520961/867574568574648352). 

### Under The Radar
* Don’t forget, you can use formulas in markdown tables with the [advanced tables plugin](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian/blob/main/docs/help.md#using-formulas-in-markdown-tables)! 
* Tidy Footnotes renumbers your footnotes if you add on in after the fact.

### For Developers
* `@Roamhacker` put together [this diagram](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/702656734631821413/866632447944163348) of the main css classes in Obsidian. 

## Workflow Stuff

* [You can iframe a calibre ebook to read an ebook in one Obsidian pane while taking notes in the other](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/workflow-reading-ebook-epub-mobi-azw-etc-in-obsidian/17977/7)
* How I go from [research to notes to stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sxyYbh5mio) video `@nickmilo` is live on YouTube, along with the AMA. If you were present and asked questions in the chat I missed, I answered them [on my blog](https://eleanorkonik.com/now-available-my-notes-stories-shortform-articles/). 
* There was a nice conversation about the [pros and cons of different tools for highlighting browser articles](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/oo96v0/trying_to_collect_my_browsing_highlights_through/) over on Reddit. 
* Here’s a nice guide for [how to build a habit tracker in Obsidian](https://www.owenvachell.com/how-to-build-a-habit-tracker-in-obsidian/). 
### Showcases

 A bunch of people shared their vaults this week, including me! 

* [My working vault](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/iterative-rainbow-folder-colors-css/21066) isn’t so much a pruned digital garden as a raw dump of my working files. I published it to make it easier to point people to examples of things. The raw [.zip](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/changelog-20210708/) is also available on my website behind a small paywall, since it also includes my actual WIP articles and fiction.
* [Mister Chad’s beautiful art resources](https://mister-chad.com/) were created for his students, but it’s an absolutely beautiful exemplar of an Obsidian publish vault and has a lot of great visual design resources. Here’s the [git repo](https://github.com/chad-bennett/obsidian-publish-css). 
* [Singlanguages](https://publish.obsidian.md/singlanguages/500+Singlanguages/Welcome+Page) is a vault about the languages of Singapore and has resources for learning a second language. 
 * Also, `@tallguyjenks` has [4 hours of PKM content](https://youtu.be/wB89lJs5A3s) going live on Monday at 08:30 UTC-7. It’s a comprehensive look into personal knowledge management, with lots of definitions covered, an overview of his system, and a skeleton vault for people to play with. 
## Feature Requests
* A bunch of folks are interested in having [Graph View presets to save and load filters & display settings](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/graph-view-presets-to-save-and-load-filters-display-settings/8131). In general there’s definitely a desire for a more robust “core” graph experience for people who don’t need the fancy Juggl stuff… ;) 
* There was a lengthy [discussion on the forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/concept-map-plugin-idea/21256) about how much folks would like a concept map plugin (as opposed to just a mind map). Think Scrapple & Miro.  
* `@pseudometa` put together [code to merge embedded notes](http://discordapp.com/channels/686053708261228577/722584061087842365/867858741370421269) into one `.md` note and was hoping someone could help out by turning it into a plugin.
## Appearance
* Minimal theme has improved support for iOS. 
* `@vainilie` shared their snippets and tricks for getting an absolutely beautiful daily note widget [over on GitHub](https://github.com/ohlinn/vainilla-style#daily-note). 
* The [Horizon theme](https://github.com/tylernguyen/obsidian-horizon) was added to the community themes list. 
* This [css snippet](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/iterative-rainbow-folder-colors-css/21066) will iteratively color folders.
## Knowledge Management
* `@hstanger` shared part three of their [digital smart notes series](https://harleystagner.com/digital-smart-notes-in-obsidian-part-3-how-to-create-permanent-notes/), about taking permanent notes in Obsidian. 

## Ancillary Tools
* [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) is another option for hosting your digital garden as a webpage for you, with no web experience required. The developer seems nice and its optimized for Obsidian. It even has a little graph and backlinks  
* YiNote is a chrome extension that lets you take timestamped notes while watching youtube videos.
* The book [Professional Git](https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Git-Brent-Laster/dp/111928497X) was edited by a community member and comes recommended for people who like textbooks for learning computer concepts. Git is a tool to help manage collaboration and version control that is pretty popular in this community, but can be overwhelming at first.
