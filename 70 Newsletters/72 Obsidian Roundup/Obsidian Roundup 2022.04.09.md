## In The Community

- Nicole van der Hoeven and Jeremy Valentine (`@javalent` is the developer of the "TTRPG suite" of plugins like dice roller, leaflet, admonitions, etc) are going to be [live on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jm5lZWy-0Y) in a couple of hours (1pm EST) to discuss his plugins & potentially some upcoming ones ðŸ‘€ 

### Hub

_The Obsidian Hub is a community knowledge base designed to help organize information about the Obsidian ecosystem. It's an excellent companion to this Roundup, which tends to be very chronological in nature. Here are some of the [recent updates](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-hub/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+sort%3Aupdated-desc+-label%3A%22scripted+update%22+-label%3A%22hub+tools+%26+scripts%22+%3E+)_

## Obsidian Updates

## Plugin News

### New in Community Plugins

*These plugins went through code review and are now available in Obsidian's plugin list.* For the full list, check out the [plugin stats page](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/new). 

### Pending (as of Friday morning)

_Note: Not all new plugins are available in the community list yet, as they need to go through code review first. You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat). Note, though, that this is not as safe as waiting for them to go through code review._

### Updates

 _If you want a comprehensive list of what plugins updated this week, check out this [plugin updates index](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/updates) by Ganessh Kumar._

### Betas

_Note: these plugins have not yet been submitted for code review, and are being made available primarily for testing purposes._

### Under The Radar

### For Developers

* `@shabegom` is looking for maintainer(s) for the [block ref counter plugin](https://github.com/shabegom/obsidian-reference-count). 

## Feature Requests

## Appearance

## Ancillary Code

## Guides


## Discussions

* Here's a lovely writeup from SÃ©bastien Dubois about how their [25 years of personal knowledge management](https://dsebastien.net/blog/2022-04-03-25-years-of-personal-knowledge-management) led them to Obsidian, and the key lessons they learned along the way, with an [accompanying discussion on HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30903940).
