## In The Community

* The first annual Linking Your Thinking Conference will be the week of Mon, May 16 - Fri, May 20. There will be talks on research, Zettelkasten, journaling, personal retreats, how folder-based paradigms might complement link-based ones, and much more.
* Enrollment for the next LYT workshop (to start on Tuesday, June 14th) opens tomorrow. 
* Bianca Pereira is running a [series of events about personal knowledge management for research](https://lu.ma/pkm-for-research-may2022).  
### Hub

_The Obsidian Hub is a community knowledge base designed to help organize information about the Obsidian ecosystem. It's an excellent companion to this Roundup, which tends to be very chronological in nature. Here are some of the [recent updates](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-hub/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+sort%3Aupdated-desc+-label%3A%22scripted+update%22+-label%3A%22hub+tools+%26+scripts%22+%3E+)_

## Obsidian Updates

## Plugin News

### New in Community Plugins

*These plugins went through code review and are now available in Obsidian's plugin list.* For the full list, check out the [plugin stats page](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/new). 

### Pending (as of Friday morning)

_Note: Not all new plugins are available in the community list yet, as they need to go through code review first. You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat). Note, though, that this is not as safe as waiting for them to go through code review._

### Updates

 _If you want a comprehensive list of what plugins updated this week, check out this [plugin updates index](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/updates) by Ganessh Kumar._

### Betas

_Note: these plugins have not yet been submitted for code review, and are being made available primarily for testing purposes._
