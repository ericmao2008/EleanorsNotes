## In The Community

* There will be a community talk about [easy automated testing for plugins](https://discord.com/events/686053708261228577/955086222261383238) on Saturday, April 9 at 9:30 EST. 
* Some of us are trying to crowdsource information about the current state of pdf/zotero/citations plugins and workflows. If you do anything with Obsidian and those things, please [check out this thread](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/pdf-zotero-obsidian-current-state-and-collaboration-for-the-one-plugin/34372) and contribute your thoughts & insights. 
### Hub

_The Obsidian Hub is a community knowledge base designed to help organize information about the Obsidian ecosystem. It's an excellent companion to this Roundup, which tends to be very chronological in nature. Here are some of the [recent updates](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-hub/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+sort%3Aupdated-desc+-label%3A%22scripted+update%22+-label%3A%22hub+tools+%26+scripts%22+%3E+)_

## Obsidian Updates

## Plugin News

### New in Community Plugins

*These plugins went through code review and are now available in Obsidian's plugin list.* For the full list, check out the [plugin stats page](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/new). 

### Pending (as of Friday morning)

_Note: Not all new plugins are available in the community list yet, as they need to go through code review first. You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat). Note, though, that this is not as safe as waiting for them to go through code review._

### Updates

 _If you want a comprehensive list of what plugins updated this week, check out this [plugin updates index](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/updates) by Ganessh Kumar._

### Betas

_Note: these plugins have not yet been submitted for code review, and are being made available primarily for testing purposes._
