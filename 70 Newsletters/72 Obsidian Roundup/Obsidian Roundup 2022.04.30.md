## In The Community

* Here's an open-source obsidian vault (via obsidian git and github) for maintaining notes on mathematical physics, physics and mathematics. It is [accepting contributions](https://github.com/Booodaness/Scientific-Notes). 
* An android developer is looking for ideas on [what mobile functionality the  community would like to have on hand](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/uc9ijt/mobile_developer_looking_for_obsidian_mobile_app/) with the Obsidian app, more quickly? 

## Obsidian Updates

* Insider [v0.14.7](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v0-14-7-insider-build/36491) has a bunch of improvements for Obsidian Publish and Sync, including an improved setup guide for Sync, a new selector for light/dark mode on Publish, and more. 

## Plugin News

### New in Community Plugins

*These plugins went through code review and are now available in Obsidian's plugin list. For the full list, check out the [plugin stats page](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/new).*  

- [Omnisearch](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch) by `@scambier`  is the new and improved search. 
- [Calibre](https://github.com/caronchen/obsidian-calibre-plugin) by `@caronchen`  lets users access their calibre libraries and read books directly in Obsidian. 
- [Obsidian Columns](https://github.com/tnichols217/obsidian-columns) by `@tnichols217`  lets users create columns more easily.  
- [Drag-n-Drop for blocks](https://github.com/artem-barmin/obsidian-block-drag-n-drop) by `@artem-barmin`  Allows for moving/copying/creating embeds for blocks with drag-n-drop just like Logseq or Roam. 
- [Notion-Like Tables](https://github.com/trey-wallis/obsidian-notion-like-tables) by `@trey-wallis`  lets users create markdown tables using an interface similar to that found in Notion.

### Pending (as of Friday morning)

_Note: Not all new plugins are available in the community list yet, as they need to go through code review first. You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat). Note, though, that this is not as safe as waiting for them to go through code review._

- [Pandoc Reference List](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-pandoc-reference-list) by `@mgmeyers`  displays a formatted reference in the sidebar for each pandoc citekey present in the current document. 
- [Release Timeline](https://github.com/cakechaser/obsidian-release-timeline) by `@cakechaser`  requites Dataview, but lets users create "yes/no" style visuals like Wikipedia's release timelines. 
- [Filename Emoji Remover](https://github.com/YTolun/obsidian-filename-emoji-remover) by `@YTolun`  automatically removes emojis from filenames; this is really handy for sanitizing Readwise imports for Dropbox syncing. I filed [an issue](https://github.com/YTolun/obsidian-filename-emoji-remover/issues/1) suggesting it be expanded out for other filename sanitazation ðŸ‘€ 
- [Paste image Png to Jpeg](https://github.com/musug/obsidian-paste-png-to-jpeg) by `@musug`  compresses and renames screenshots when you paste them into Obsidian. 
- [Folder Index](https://github.com/turulix/obsidian-folder-index) by `@turulix`  will automatically generate a table of contents for the current folder. 
- [AutoMOC](https://github.com/dalcantara7/obsidian-auto-moc) by `@dalcantara7`  looks for missing linked mentions to the current note and imports them into the current note.
