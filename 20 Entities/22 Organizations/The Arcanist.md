## Looking For
- strong characters

## Hard Sells

-   Meta stories (stories about writing a story, etc.)
-   Stories with passive characters
-   Excessive gore (don’t be gross just to be gross. Gore is fine if there’s a reason)
-   Excessive sex and/or porn (Character has a sex scene? Fine. But, again, there better be a reason why you’re dwelling on it)
-   No fanfiction (There are other places for this sort of thing)
-   Extremely vulgar works (Keep your potty mouths in check)
-   Hate speech, racism, and other offensive material (‘nuff said)
-   No poetry
