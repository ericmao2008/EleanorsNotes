## Correspondance with Anya
- [approving the idea of a piece about the Sicilian expedition](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?zx=rocdqz27h6k4#search/Anya/FMfcgxwLsSZgRDstdvNSKBLLsxlWkpMN)

> As for an article, I ran a search of the archives and other than your pieces on the Sicilian expedition in the Peloponnesian War summary, it doesn't look like too much about Syracuse has been covered. I'm actually in the middle of annotating Jeff Champion's "The Tyrants of Syracuse" Vol. 1 and was planning on using that as a jumping off point for some articles along the lines of "yep, that dynamic sounds familiar" — how does that sound?
