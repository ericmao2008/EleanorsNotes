## I Asked

- [p] [What do we know about how Deborah and the other Judges came to power?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/pdklpr/what_do_we_know_about_how_deborah_and_the_other/)

## I Liked

- [Which New Testament epistles did Paul actually write](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/uq26n8/which_nt_epistles_did_paul_actually_write/) because it provides evidence of something I learned in college, namely that many scholars think Paul didn't actually write everything that wound up attributed to him.
