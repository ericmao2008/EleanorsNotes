I promised to write an article every _Third Thursday_ for paying subscribers to the Obsidian Roundup. Currently, this is my "highest paying market" and is therefore my top priority. 

Ideas for this are listed as `#nonfic/articleSeed/thoughts`  in the tag index, and below: 

- [ ] Respond to the "Obsidian is too complicated / uses too many plugins" article as a longform retort based on the "Safemode Notetaking" talk for the LYT Conference. Nick will probably help promote it, based on [this email](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?tab=rm&ogbl=#inbox%2FCllgCHrgCbKKTGbLlqFRSCnRDvDlNWtphFkdKgdmmjklVRjvQdGLZsqdfHBTCfcGLJNpRqPCVrL=). 
- [ ] wrote about [how I handle sourcing of ideas in Obsidian](https://twitter.com/EleanorKonik/status/1487766375020044288) on Twitter, it can be expanded. 
- [ ] Discussed my [annotation workflow](https://twitter.com/monicarysavy/status/1487774253218938882) on Twitter, it can be expanded.
