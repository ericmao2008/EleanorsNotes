- [i] The Deadlands wants critical, academic, and personal essays from everywhere and from everyone. We have likely reached our current limit of pieces having to deal with cemeteries, and would rather see work exploring other aspects of death, including but not limited to Death cards in tarot decks, mourning clothing from specific cultures, memento mori, death/mourning jewelry, funeral rites, and the like.

- They pay $100 per essay. 
- This would be a _great_ market for [[Suicide in Dune Was a Double Waste]], not least of which because they actually pay more than Tor and are a smaller market. 
- Here are the [submissions guidelines](https://thedeadlands.com/guidelines/?s=03#nonfiction), but the tl;dr is that they want an essay between 1k & 4k.
