- [Tips for creating interesting and coherent systems of social arrangements](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/uqhu19/tips_for_creating_interesting_and_coherent/) because it is a nice overview of how [[The Dawn of Everything by David Graeber & David Wengrow]] can be made useful for worldbuilding.
