My (very) [short fiction & research newsletter](http://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/), which ships a research overview every Monday, and a microfiction + afterword every Wednesday. I send notes updates on the First Friday, and flash fiction + afterword every Fourth Friday. 

## Todo

### Survey

- survey to newsletter folks asking if they'd be interested in fiction, more deep dives, etc. 
- optional bonus stories / by request / voting for favorite characters to appear  in the next batch of stories, etc. 

### Anthology

- [ ] create an anthology (chronicles of verraine, vol 1, 2, etc) that consists of:
	- [ ] 1 page flash fiction
	- [ ] 1 page the did-you-know research thing
	- [ ] with bonus never-before-seen worldbuilding articles as the hook to get people to buy the anthology even if they've read the story

Includes bonus sneak peak into my personal wiki encyclopedic worldbuilding notes. 

## Backlog

- [ ] idea: 6 flash fiction and the research that spawned it, mini papers for amazon kindle along the format of [[SMP-IEVFF-2008.doc]]
