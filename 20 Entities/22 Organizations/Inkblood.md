## Looking For

Strong and fresh worldbuilding, tight prose, slow burns, purposeful pacing, original or rare creatures, unusual framing devices, small-scale plots, and diverse characters. "Literary"-style stories and genre mash-ups (Science Fantasy, for example) are also of interest!

## Hard Sells

- "It was Earth all along!"  
- Run-of-the-mill horror devices (Dracula, zombies, Frankenstein's monster, werewolves, demons, ghosts, haunted dolls, creepy children, serial killers...)  
- Pseudo-medieval-or-Renaissance-England settings  
- Extreme violence or explicit sexual content that doesn't have a good reason to be there (and even then, we do have limits)  
- Stories originally written for a themed publication or contest  
- Near-Future Science Fiction, Magical Realism, Surreal Fiction, Parody or Comedy  
- Common retellings (Cinderella, Percy Jackson, Beowulf)

## Don't Submit

- Works that are not speculative fiction  
- Glorified violence, slasher fic, hateful or discriminatory content, or pornography  
- Romanticization or exploitation of mental illness  
- Stories torn from your RPG campaign, trunk stories, or repackaged fanfiction  
- Stories in which the male protagonist is comparable to Gaston or the female protagonist is Not Like Other Girls  
- Witchcraft is Satanism! Or, Paganism is Satanism!  
- Nazis (Space Nazis, Wizard Nazis, Neo-Nazis, Nazis but they're communist...you get the idea)  
- \[Religion or Political Belief\] is the cause of all our strife/is the only thing that can save us!
