> Hi everyone! I'm Sarah Pauling (she/her) or @_paulings on Twitter. I've just moved (as in, we got here yesterday!) to Seattle with my husband and 2 kittens from Ann Arbor, MI where I was a study abroad advisor. I love humor, cyberpunk, unusual looks at religion, and queer things.
> 
> I'm also an associate editor for Luna Station Quarterly, which is a lovely but low-volume magazine of SFF by women writers, and I'm really excited to do more slushing and refine my skillset! I've had some short fiction published in Strange Horizons, Clarkesworld, Escape Pod, and other places. Hobbies include tabletop gaming and reading comics in order to complain about them. Looking forward to working with you!

She’s in the diabolical Plots slush reader discord.
