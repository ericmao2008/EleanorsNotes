## I Answered

## I liked

- [In 400 AD Rome hosted a population of well over a million people, 200 years later the population of the city was counted in low tens of thousands. So, was there just a gigantic empty ghost town located in the center of Italy? What happened to all that infrastructure?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ungz8t/in_400_ad_rome_hosted_a_population_of_well_over_a/) because the answer is specifically talking about the decline of Roman infrastructure, but does a good job of explaining how, for example, amphitheatres become farms, stone buildings for housing get reused. 
- [Can obsidian be turned into a sword like weapon?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ul4de5/can_obsidian_be_turned_into_a_sword_like_weapon/) because it does a really good job of showing how Obsidian developed as a weapon materiel in Mesoamerica. #nonfic/overviewTopic/knives
- This thread asks [what makes "Milk and Honey" so special in Abrahamic religion?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kuxui4/what_makes_milk_and_honey_so_special_in_abrahamic/) and the answer goes into detail about [[Phoenician]] trade in a way that really kind of makes me think of Phoenicia as being very similar to Poland in that the Caananites were sort of trapped between superpowers and although the Caananite city-states were culturally aligned with one another, the different city-states fell to different powers at different times (i.e. [[Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia|Assyria]]). The main takeaway (and what I added to these notes) is that milk and honey was able to be traded by the Phoenicians because the mountain part of their territory wasn't taken over as much and couldn't support "normal" agriculture but they could raise sheep and have advanced beekeeping, so it became "the land from which milk and honey flows." Milk and honey didn't mean "wealth" to the Israelites (they weren't luxury goods or anything) it meant *safety* because the Phoenican coast was fairly safe from invaders, which the Israelites would have valued. 
- This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l7ga78/the_five_element_system_earth_water_fire_air/?user_id=107156619577) via [[rAskHistorians]] does a really nice job of clearing up misconceptions about whether or not the elements of [[classical antiquity]] really grew out of [[Greek]] thought: the tl;dr on this is that Aristotle and Plato are *erroneously* both given credit for the 5 elements theory (earth, air, wind, fire, spirit). 
 * Found this [fascinating history of the pound vs the dollary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/m3up5n/australia_new_zealand_and_canada_all_switched/) on [[rAskHistorians]] that details how the pound is not uniquely British, and the dollar is not uniquely American.  ^5ce926
- the popularity of long straight swords throughout post-[[Roman]] Europe and Asia mostly has to do with similarities to the Roman weapons. Curved weapons were probably more effective, but were often considered "lower class" because of their resemblance to peasant weapons. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ktzkix/why_were_curved_swords_more_prevalent_in_eastern/)
- At the end of the "[[Bronze Age]]," iron tools were broken during funerary rights as a status symbol, and iron tools and weapons would have been limited mostly to the elite. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ktqfar/it_is_1000_bce_and_im_a_farmer_in_the_eastern/)
- [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/emq127/the_incas_were_able_to_construct_one_of_the/fdqq5e5/) thread about gift economies in lieu of money among the [[Incan|Inca]] is going to be really useful for refactoring [[Civil Mage|Civil Mage]] to not have a monetary system (see also: [[Coins and Commodity Money]]) but I don't have the mental capacity right now to really mine it for details. It also talks about the tribute system and how taxation in terms of labor during the "off" months was less problematic than a tax on harvest goods a la feudalism. 
	* Incidentally, there was a comment that said "This reminds me of the trade / debt value system in the goblin market in the Wayward Children series." that inspired [[5 SFF Stories With Unconventional Economic Systems]]
- [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gu1tj5/did_people_realize_they_were_part_of_a/ftb9pet/?context=3) is an absolutely amazing post on the [[Bronze Age]] "collapse" that seems like it would be amazing story fodder. It's also specifically about a book I own, 1177BC: The Year Civilization Collapsed by Eric H Cline (and the flaws with it). 
- [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/esuwlr/how_did_carthage_raise_an_army_if_they_nearsolely/ffeckip/) is a great thread about the composition of [[Phoenician|Carthaginian]] armies and their navy, which has some great tie-ins with [[The Tyrants of Syracuse by Jeff Champion]]. 
- [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l8zfmc/did_the_99_feel_rome_declining/) in [[rAskHistorians]] really reminded me of the homilies given in L. E. Modesitt's *Imager Portfolio* -- I hadn't realized they were an actual thing that happened in the early Christian church, and now I want to riff off of that for my [[Backwards Mapping Fiction]] series. 

### [[rAskHistorians|r/AskHistorians]] > [How do sleep patterns vary between forager and farming communities?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fanssm/have_sleep_patterns_always_been_the_same_i_read/fj1ejya/)
> In these situations, how one sleeps becomes a part of how one's social world is reified. So this seemingly inconsequential habit becomes related to how you tend your home's fire, how you build your house, how often you have sex with your partner, how your partner feels about sexuality, if your husband will cheat on you, how often your infant is held, and whether your toddler will be hit by another in child-on-child violence. 
I read this great comment about how sleep patterns are incredibly tied to culture. It's great for stuff like how the [[Monche Nomads]] might wake up often to tend a fire, and how groups in pastoral communities cosleep. ^95daf6



### [[rAskHistorians|r/AskHistorians]] > [Did ancient societies just go out every summer to fight each other over nothing in particular?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/klfwu4/did_ancient_societies_just_go_out_every_summer_to/)
> So in several premodern societies you literally had a dedicated class that would go out of its way to wage war for profit, for power and for glory, and not necessarily in a a centralized way, as allies in a former campaign could later become bitter enemies over the division of the spoils of war. Do bear in mind that not all military operations were epic wars of conquest, not at all, many times these groups were content with merely raiding and plundering border territories and carrying off with the loot before effective resistance could be mounted.

This is a genuinely fantastic explanation of why raids (such as those fought in [[Lysaria]] prior to the [[Unification War]] were fought. 
### [[rAskHistorians|r/AskHistorians]] > [How advanced were Mesoamerican societies compared to their northern counterparts?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/k30toz/why_were_the_meso_american_tribes_so_much_more/gf997n2/?context=3)
> Trade networks connected Puebloans all the way to Mesoamerica, largely through tribes that the Mesoamericans labelled as Chichimec, but these trade links cannot be ignored due to their scale. The formation of Plains Indian Sign Language (PISL) possibly occurred in this period, considering by the time Europeans arrived, around half of the continental United States was already engaged in the use of universal trade signs between them. The Puebloans are also known to have produced, apart from cities, certain defensive works, and great palaces as well.
>
> Now, while neither necessarily built, say, dams, aqueducts, and chinampas like the Mesoamericans did, they had their own things to deal with. Mississippians didn't have any shortage of water and figured out their own solutions to dealing with the river (mound-building, for instance, may have started as a defense against floods, and city walls likewise), while the Puebloans figured out irrigation in the relatively arid and mountainous climate of their homeland, able to get the most out of their crops. Both cultures adopted the Three Sisters agricultural system around this time, which significantly contributed to crop and diet diversity, and made every inch of land all the more productive. They're not less advanced, they're just coming to different solutions.

Some really useful notes about [[2020.08.24 Chichimecs|Chichimecs]] and [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]] civilizations, and especially some useful information for best practices for agriculture that might be useful for the Temple of [[The Gardener]].
