Disability Accommodations in Ancient Greece by Dr. [[Deborah Sneed]]

* Religion wasn't really "optional" in the ancient greece. The focus of a particular practice might be different by person, i.e. pregnant people vs. sailor might travel to a different temple to worship. 
* Ramps in temples aren't for the "usual reasons" — You wouldn't roll a wagon into a temple, animal sacrifices were outside, treasuries (for "heavy dedications") don't have ramps!

left side is the "secular" part. This is basically the smallest functional possible design for a functioning sanctuary. Has 2 ramps! The ramp pretty clearly had a very nice design (stucco, gate), was long, wide, etc. and went to just a dining room — you wouldn't take livestock or huge wagons into that room! 

The pattern was that ramps were most common at healing sanctuaries. May have specialized in "lower body ailments" There are an unusual number of leg and feet votives. 

* the concept of accommodations implies an abelist framework to begin with, but the Greeks didn't do that because they ... didn't organize themselves around setting up for non-disabled piece. Legal mechanisms don't necessarily _need_ to exist in order to "enforce" changes, for example an imaginary world in which there are ONLY first-floor houses so they don't need to "accommodate" disabled wheelchair users. 

* crutches and canes used on vase paintings pretty common and were mobility devices for disabled people and that was shown on the artwork itself. 

* capua limb is a prosethetic.
