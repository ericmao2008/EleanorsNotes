- [i] Today's topic is "publishing and editing things." 

[[Scott H. Andrews]] of [[Beneath Ceaseless Skies]] is an older white guy with a greying beard. [[Cat Rambo]], the "hostess" of the class, is an older white woman, greying hair.  Looks like about 20 people signed up for the class. 

## Introductions

- name
- pronoun preferences
- geographical location 
- one reason you're taking this class. 
	- I publish microfiction and flash fiction on a weekly basis to paying subscribers, so I'm trying to get some tips on how to more quickly iterate through the self-editing process so quality doesn't dip as I burn through my backlog. With regards to openings, I particularly struggle with clarity. 

## Lecture

* color-coded according to how they get assigned, whether they got submitted by someone they trust to "jump the queue." 
* [[Beneath Ceaseless Skies]] gets about 300 a month (up 50% during the pandemic). [[Clarkesworld]] gets about 1100 a month. Fantasy gets about 2k a sub period. 
	* ~25% are tired/common ideas (d&d adventures, teen vampires, etc)
		* fantasy tavern
		* zombies
	* ~33% are "amateur level writing"
	* ~50% are "competent"
		* no new insight or new take on things, no unique personal or emotional investment from the author. 
		* _shows_ character, conflict, emotion, but not doesn't make the reader _feel_ it (not personal, digging deep, no emotional investment, no resonance). ==My stories often start this way.==

### Editor preferences
* Neil Clarke: "something that makes him think or feel" [[Clarkesworld]]
* Shiela Williams [[Asimov's]]: "stories that integrate intriguing characters and clever plotting with well-developed science." 
* [[Scott H. Andrews]] of [[Beneath Ceaseless Skies]]: "awed" by the world or cool details or the voice or a new take on things, and emotionally "moved" by a character emotion, profoundness, humanity. Tiny person "looking up" at the immensity of the world. 

### Opening Paragraphs
* seize the reader ("hook") with...
	* a thing to empathize with or engage with, for example:
		* interesting person
		* detail 
		* observation interaction.
	* sense of voice, bonus for humor. 
	* a sense of character with a personality / attitude or drive / or goal. 
	* a sense of setting or world (some detail or view or vibe of an interesting place or setting) — i.e. "the clock struck thirteen." 
	* sense of conflict / stakes / threat. 
	* a sense of tension (curiosity, jeopard, contradiction, mystery) — keep them reading so they can figure out the reference.  
	* you can absolutely do bold statements like "The door has three locks, and I am their key." 
* ...because you have to keep the reader reading. It's not a checklist. 
* you can open _in media res_ with an ongoing or nascent something that's important or significant. 

He likes first person point of view. He likes "the feel of a physical thing being built; vivid details of things being created." 

### Bad Elements

* problems can be "low stakes" "not enough details" "big infodump"
* "gratuitous hook in the first line" i.e. something that you find out isn't "real"
* _in media res_ in the middle of physical action when you don't know the stakes for the character yet. "If I don't know why they're in a swordfight I don't care that they're in a sword fight."
* too little context that is _gratuitously_ hiding information "to create mystery or suspense." 

### Expectations 

* subgenre impacts how a reader approaches a piece. 
* make sure the payoff is correctly telegraphed — don't give the reader a reason to stop reading. 

## Common Structural Strategies

* start on a day that's "different" because there's a change happening in the world, character, or plot. 
* a person, in a place, with a problem. I do this with [[2022.01.05 The Magic of Marsh Protection (FF)]].
* inciting incident, "event that thrusts the protagonist into the main action of the story."

* What to focus on?
	* get to the inciting incident (main action / plot / arc right away)
	* focus on an aspect of the world.
	* briefly on an aspect of the unique or startling character
	* "bridging conflict" — something temporary to keep things engaging until the inciting incident. Dresden Files does this a lot, and it usually ties into a subplot. This is better for novels than short stories. 
* Consider:
	* what is most _important_
	* what is easiest to _understand_
	* ==what best sets up the _throughline_ for the story.==

* Make sure to balance exposition — don't do it for too long, live action is important... but live action can be harder for readers to understand, so also don't do _that_ for too long.

* Character is very important; he wants a reader surrogate, that's easier in first person.
