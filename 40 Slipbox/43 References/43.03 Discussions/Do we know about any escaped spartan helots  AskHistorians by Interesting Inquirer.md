### id282225532 The Messenian revolt was the most successful slave revolt 

> Do we know of any Helots that escaped? Yes, we know of potentially thousands that escaped from Spartan control during the Peloponnesian War. The Messenian revolt in c. 464 can be considered one of the most successful slave revolts of all time. However, we unfortunately do not know of any individuals in any meaningful capacity, nor do we have anything that suggests an escaped Helot wrote something about their servitude after they escaped.

### id282225568 Spartan Helots revolted otten

> The Helots were notorious for their revolts. Aristotle tells us that the Helots were like an enemy constantly lying in wait for the Spartans (Arist. [Pol. 1269a](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D2%3Asection%3D1269a)). Plato tells us that he thought that the numerous rebellions were the greatest flaw of Helotage as a system ([Laws 776c-777c](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0166%3Abook%3D6%3Apage%3D776)). Thucydides says that all Spartan policies have been governed by fear of the Helots ([4.80](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+4.80&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200)). Thucydides even claimed that fear of the Helots was one motivation for the Spartans to end the Archidamian War ([5.14](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D14); [5.23](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D23)) Of course, all these writers were writing with the benefit of hindsight, the greatest Helot revolts having happened prior to their careers. It is possible that Helotage had existed for several hundred years without any major incidents.

### id282225583 the historicity of the Second Messenian War is debated

> The first major incident that could be considered a possible Helot revolt is the so-called 'Second Messenian War'. The historicity of this event and whether the Messenians involved were at this point under the conditions of Helotage are much debated. It is possible Tyrtaios, a contemporary Spartan poet, *might* have been involved. His poetry is much too fragmented to get a clear picture from it alone, and later testimony is not unanimous. Pausanias, writing in the 2nd c. AD, is our most complete source on the topic, but Pausanias was utilising sources from the Hellenistic period which Pausanias himself noted were not wholly reliable ([4.6.1-2](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+4.6&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160)). Moreover, Pausanias, who presumably had greater access to Tyrtaios' poetry than we do, tells us that the Messenians were not yet subject to Helotage, but were so after this conflict ([4.14.5-6](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+4.14&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160); [4.24.5](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D24)). So, this war may not have happened, instead being a nationalistic invention of the Hellenistic period, and even if it had, those involved might not have been Helots. That said, some Messenians are said to have gone to Zankle prior to the end of this conflict, and could be considered the first Helots to escape servitude to the Spartans (Paus. [4.23.6](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D23)).

### id282225586 the Messenian revolt was instigated by an earthquake

> The Messenian revolt of 464BC is arguably one of the most important events in Helot and Spartan history. Our main source for the event is Thucydides ([1.101-3](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+1.101.&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200)). He tells us that an earthquake brought a great deal of destruction to Sparta, collapsing many of the buildings, killing those within. The Helots took this opportunity to rebel and fled to Mt. Ithome, which they fortified and defended against Sparta and her allies for ten years (Herodotos actually tells us of the death of a famous Spartan in this war: [9.64](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.64&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126)). These Helots were actually allowed to leave Mt. Ithome and the Peloponnese, being settled in Naupaktos by the Athenians, adopting the name Messenians.

### id282225586a the Messenian revolt was ethnically motivated

> It is important to note that this was not solely a Helot revolt, but included two Messenian *perioikoi*, Thouria and Aithia, and was likely a revolt motivated by ethnic consciousness.

### id282225718 Messenian forts helped Helots escape

> This new polity of Messenians, the Messenians in exile, would be involved in the garrisoning of a fort in Spartan territory at Pylos throughout the Peloponnesian War. Similarly, the island of Kythera was garrisoned by Athenian troops. From these two locations, the Helots were encouraged to escape from Spartan control (Thuc. [5.14](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+5.14&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200)). The Helots who escaped, primarily via Pylos on the coast of Messenia, were settled in Kranioi (Thuc. [5.35](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+5.14&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200)). These Helots were then said to be involved in the encouragement of more Helots to escape (Thuc. [5.56](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+5.56&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200)). Another fort, similar to Pylos, was established on the coast of Lakonia, again to encourage the Helots to revolt, or at least escape (Thuc. [7.26](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+7.26&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200)).

### id282225748 Spartan forts helped Athenian slaves escape

> As we can see, and as the sources attest, the Helots appear to have been quite prone to escaping from Spartan control. Particularly during the Peloponnesian War, this became an important strategy of the Athenians, hoping to perhaps destabilise Spartan territory with raids and Helot revolts. However, it is important to remember that this willingness to escape was not unique to the Helots and was not the product of any particularly harsh treatment of the Helots by the Spartans. The Spartans established a fort within Attika at Dekeleia, and from there plundered the land about Athens, and more than 20,000 slaves are said to have escaped to that fort (Thuc. [7.27](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200%3Abook%3D7%3Achapter%3D27)).

### id282225760 Ancient Greek anti-slavery sentiments existed

> It is possible that the revolt of 464 began to spur some anti-slavery sentiment in ancient Greece, although this debate gained much more traction in the 4th century. Alkidamas' 'Messenian Oration' argued for the release of the Messenians (Arist. *Rhet*. [1373b](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0060%3Abekker+page%3D1373b)), and Aristotle records the existence of a school of thought that all men were equal and thus slavery was unnatural (Arist. *Pol*. [1253b.20](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D1253b)).
> 
> Euripides is one ancient Greek who may possibly have expressed something akin to anti-slavery statements, or at least something that may have appeared radical at the time. In his *Hekuba* he condemns slavery generally ([332-3](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0098%3Acard%3D299)), and in *Ion* he stressed the equality of man ([854-6](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0110%3Acard%3D836)).
> 
> Slavery is a very difficult topic to actually get as close to a contemporary understanding as we can, mainly due to the sources. Aristotle, for example, is ardently pro-slavery, but he may have been a ruthless slave master, his views not shared by the many. Alternatively, Euripides' statements about the equality of man might have been controversial among his Athenian audience.
