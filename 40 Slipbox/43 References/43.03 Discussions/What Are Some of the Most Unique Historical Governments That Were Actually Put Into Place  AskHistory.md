## Highlights

### q1 the government of Silla was unique and functional

> Silla, one of the ancient kingdoms of the Korean Peninsula, had a unique governance structure. From the first king to the 56th king, three families, Park, Seok and Kim, took turns succeeding to the throne. Although the exact order or timing of rule was not set, on average, three kings from one family ruled consecutively, and then another family took over the throne. This was not a political dispute, agreement, vote, or civil war, but a thoroughly conventional outcome. Many studies are also being conducted on how peaceful succession of the throne between different families was possible. (The most likely theory is that the Seok and Kim families were derived from the founder's family, Park.) From the 17th to the 52nd kings, Kim monopolized the throne, this was because Park and Seok families did not have an orthodox eldest son. And since there were three kings again in the Park family at the end of Silla, it was not an absolute monopoly of the Kim family. (The Park family was also considered to be different from the other two royal families and nobles, as the first king's family. The first king was worshipped like a god, and even during the Kim family's monopoly on the throne, the Park family was at the center of Silla's political forces.) Silla also had the "Hwabeak Conference," a senate of aristocrats, in addition to the royal family of three families. The meeting was a political organization of aristocrats to keep the king and the royal family in check, and unanimously decided on each agenda. With the exception of the early Silla period, the king could not intervene in the meeting and the decision made through the meeting was absolute. Thus, Silla had a unique structure in which various forms of political power existed at the same time, including one king, three families of royal throne, and aristocratic government.
