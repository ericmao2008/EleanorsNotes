## Highlights

### id253598453

> Despite the ubiquity of references to ‘feast and famine’ in the literature describing our hunter–gatherer ancestors, it has rarely been tested whether hunter–gatherers suffer from more famine than other societies

### id253598451 hunter-gatherers in warm climates experience less famine  than agriculturists

> This is the first study to report that, if we control for habitat quality, hunter–gatherers actually had significantly less—not more—famine than other subsistence modes. This finding challenges some of the assumptions underlying for models of the evolution of the human diet, as well as our understanding of the recent epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### id253598505

> We specifically examine these data as they relate to two hypotheses: (i) hunter–gatherers suffer more famine, which has resulted in the thrifty genotype adaptation in humans and (ii) hunter–gatherers ethnographically described in the last century (since the mid-1800s) mostly lived in unproductive habitats because more powerful people had taken over better, more productive habitats.

### id253598525 the western diet increases obesity levels

> Early evidence for the thrifty genotype hypothesis was presented as case studies from the Samoans, Pima Native Americans and Yanomami, because they experienced rapidly increasing levels of obesity after abandoning their traditional diets. However, these groups had actually been practising non-intensive agriculture (often horticulture with hunting) for a long time [[7](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2013.0853/)–[9](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2013.0853/)]. These early case studies actually support the idea that it was the ‘westernization’ of the diet, rather than the transition to agriculture that has caused the increased incidence of obesity and T2DM in these populations. Nevertheless, several recent diet books are based on the premise that humans are adapted to a diet that consists regularly of periods of feast and famine—and thus recommend periodic fasting

### id253598543

> To the best of our knowledge, only two studies [[19](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2013.0853/),[20](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2013.0853/)] have analysed famine and food shortages across different modes of subsistence. Neither of these studies considered habitat quality in their analyses, and neither found differences in the frequency of famine between hunter–gatherers and agriculturalists. However, approximately half of the hunter–gatherer societies in both studies are Arctic or subarctic, whereas very few agriculturalists live in the Arctic or subarctic. Thus, the agricultural versus hunter–gatherer societies in these samples are not comparable in terms of climate and habitat. Our study is the first to report that, controlling for habitat quality, hunter–gatherers have less famine than agriculturalists.

### id253609186 famine is more common in bad climates 

> Warm-climate hunter–gatherers had a significantly lower frequency of famine than cold-climate hunter–gatherers in two variables: occurrence of famine and persistence of famine. Also, planning for famine (contingency of famine) was significantly more common in cold-climate hunter–gatherers than warm-climate hunter–gatherers

### id253609629

> Three measures of famine frequency all showed significantly less frequent famine in hunter–gatherer societies than in agricultural societies: occurrence of famine, persistence of famine and recurrence of famine. Hunter–gatherers had significantly less frequent famine than agriculturalists

### id253610372 a thrifty genotype would post-date agriculture

> Warm-climate hunter–gatherers actually experience fewer famines than societies with other modes of subsistence. This is an important result, because these findings do not support the association between frequent famine and hunter–gatherer lifestyles. It may suggest that if there is a ‘thrifty genotype’, it has a more recent origin and may have swept human populations since the advent of agriculture

### id253610848 cultural adaptations to marginal habitats

> While few people would assert that any people of today live exactly as early humans did, our results provide some evidence that hunter–gatherers documented over the last century were not all living in strictly marginal habitats. By contrast, by definition cold-climate hunter–gatherers live in marginal habitats. As a consequence, cold-climate hunter–gatherers have many derived cultural adaptations to cope with more frequent food shortages, such as infanticide of females, food storage, long-distance migrations, marine hunting technology and complex trade networks
