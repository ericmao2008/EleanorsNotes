> As long-time readers will realize, we struggle to deal with the wet ground in certain parts of our garden, so seeing how well these little chinampas do has been an eye-opening experience. I decided to go ahead and dig the back garden into similar raised beds to ensure that this year's tomatoes don't suffer from wet feet.

### id264179374 methods to evaluate soil swampiness

> You'll know if your soil is wet enough to need small-scale chinampas because rushes and sedges will be growing in the mown aisles along with grass. To confirm that the groundwater is too high for the soil to be planted into as-is, dig around a clump of earth, then grab the grass on top as if lifting the clump up by its hair. If the soil is well-drained, the whole clump will stay together since roots go straight down into the subsoil. If the soil is waterlogged, the top will peel off since the plant roots stayed in the inch or two of soil above the water.

   I can imagine a priestess teaching this to a group of refugees. Perhaps from the [[Salted Wars]] who come to [[Maehlorn]] to escape the [[Cult of Valor]]? Could be shades of the [[Battle of Adrianople]] and the thing about the Germanic tribes being pushed into Roman territories by the Mongols.
