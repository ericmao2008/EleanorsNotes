## Annotations

### reindeer

> When the snow in Siberia first begins to thaw, reindeer native to the region will hoof up fly agaric mushrooms sitting just below the surface of the snow.

> “Herders would capture the reindeer, because the hallucinogen doesn’t go away from [the reindeers’] system and goes straight into the urine,” says Locke. “So they drink the urine from the reindeer to get their own hallucination.”

not relevant to my question, but super fascinating.

### cats

> catnip — nepetalactone — mimics female pheromones and drives cats into intense fits of arousal. Both females and males react to it, though, doing everything from chasing invisible mice to rolling on the ground uncontrollably.

### dolphins

> pufferfish, which emits one of the deadliest poisons in the world when it feels it’s being threatened. That said, in small doses its tetrodotoxin can be mildly hallucinogenic, juvenile rough-tooths pass it around like a spiny, swimming joint to get high. “They don’t really kill it; they just bite it to get it to release its neurotoxins,”

### jaguars

jaguars native to the Amazon eat ayahuasca vines (yage). ayahuasca is used in mysthical ceremonies. The jaguars "turn into rolling goofballs."
