### p223 humans have suffered the effects of self-inflicted climate problems since the Neolithic era

> Sustainable forest management continued until the cumulative effects of tree-felling may have led to landscape degradation at the end of the PPNC. Adzes replace axes as heavy woodworking tools during the pottery Neolithic A (PNA) period, but by the PNB period, once again there are more carpentry tools than tree-felling bifaces. The trend is reversed again during the Chalcolithic, when the demand for fire wood, lumber, and cleared land seems to have increased during a time of emerging socioeconomic complexity

- [i] Added to [[climate change has had major impacts on history]]; particularly relevant since this was human-caused deforestation.

### p226

> Handaxes were common during the Lower Paleolithic but were replaced by Middle and Upper Paleolithic flake and blade tools. Bifaces did not reappear until the Epipaleolithic after a hiatus of some 185,000 years

### p226

> PPNA bifacial tools included polished axes made of green stone and other coarse-grained materials.

PPNA refers to the pre-pottery neolithic era "a"

### p227

> Polished axes were made before agropastoral systems were established and were found in special contexts within settlements. Their function was probably symbolic

### p227

> The appearance of visually distinctive PPNA polished stone axes that were not created to clear forests shows that they were social and spiritual symbols that helped define individual roles in societies and new relations with nature.

### p227

> Use of green stones for PPNA and EPPNB polished axes had special significance (fig. 2D). Bar-Yosef Mayer and Porat (2008) reported that ornaments made of green stones do not appear in the Levant until the Neolithic. They suggest that green was associated with vegetation, rain, fertility, virility, and strength, and that PPNA cultivator-foragers (and PPNB farmers) obtained green stone from sources quite far from their settlements.

> However, two of four EPPNB polished axes had woodworking wear traces on their edges (table 1). One of these axes was made of green stone (fig. 2D).

### p229 climate change, deforestation, and overgrazing led to an environmental crisis in the Neolithic era

> Sustainable forest management during the PPNB allowed agropastoralists to increase their population and complexity, but the cumulative effects of climate change, tree-felling, and grazing seem to have led to degradation. By felling too many trees for fields and grazing lands, LPPNB/PPNC groups may have triggered an environmental crisis that led to dispersal to smaller PN sites (Rollefson et al. 1992; Simmons 2007; Weninger et al. 2009). This was when adzes replaced axes as the primary woodworking tool and chisels increase in abundance

### p231

> Changes in Neolithic and Chalcolithic bifaces track technological developments during the Neolithization process, but bifaces were also cultural markers that reflect changes in status, leadership, and social relations (Barkai and Yerkes 2008). The polished axes made during the PPNA and EPPNB should have been used to clear forests and tame the wilderness, but their function was more symbolic than secular. Microwear analysis showed how woodworking tool kits were created and used over time. PPNA and EPPNB flint axes and chisels were not used to fell large trees but rather for clearing brush and for carpentry. Wood was needed for beams and poles in PPNA and EPPNB, but carpentry tools needed to construct these structures were modified when the transition to agriculture led to more forest clearance. Even more wood was needed for larger buildings during the MPPNB, LPPNB, and PPNC periods, and heavy-duty flint axes with ground and polished bits were made and used for more demanding tasks.

### p231

> PPNB agricultural lifeways led to intensive exploitation of the landscape, but stable forest management practices were practiced for 2,100 years before agropastoral expansion outpaced the forest rejuvenation, and large villages were abandoned as selfsufficient agropastoralists dispersed to smaller PN sites. This was when the more versatile adze replaced the ax and seemed to fit the changing needs of PN groups. During the Chalcolithic, more wood was needed for metal and ceramic production and agricultural intensification. Climate change, sociocultural evolution, and population growth shaped the societies of the Levant. Lithic artifact analysis provides a framework for tracking human responses to these forces and new insights about sustainable systems that supported villagers for 5,000 years and laid the foundation for the complex societies in the region during the later Chalcolithic period.
