## Highlights

### q1 complex kitchens date to 30k years ago

> archaeologists have just uncovered a 29,000 B.C. well-equipped kitchen where roasted gigantic mammoth was one of the last meals served.
>
> Svoboda, a professor at the University of Brno and director of its Institute of Archaeology, and colleagues recently excavated Pavlov VI, where they found the remains of a female [mammoth](http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/09/09/neanderthal-mammoth.html) and one [mammoth](http://animals.howstuffworks.com/extinct-animals/mammoth-info.htm) calf near a 4-foot-wide roasting pit. Arctic fox, wolverine, bear and hare remains were also found, along with a few horse and reindeer bones.
> 
> The meats were cooked luau-style underground. Svoboda said, "We found the heating stones still within the pit and around."
> 
> Boiling pits existed near the middle roaster. He thinks "the whole situation — central roasting pit and the circle of boiling pits — was sheltered by a teepee or yurt-like structure."

This is probably the thing [[Does the Full-Size Oven Have a Place in the Modern Home]] got wrong. 


### q3 decorated shells were found near prehistoric ovens 

> It's unclear if seafood was added to create a surf-and-turf meal, but multiple decorated shells were unearthed. Many showed signs of cut marks, along with red and black coloration. The scientists additionally found numerous stone tools, such as spatulas, blades and saws, which they suggest were good for carving mammoths.
> 
> Perforated, decorative pebbles, ceramic pieces and fragments of fired clay were also excavated.

### q5 ceramic art 30k years ago

> This carnivore head was first modeled of wet clay, then an incision was made with a sharp tool, and finally the piece was heated in the fire, turned into some kind of ceramic,"

This is a great example of early [[ceramics]]. #nonfic/twitterFodder for [[2021.10.04 Ovens]] and [[2021.01.24 Ceramics]]
