### id262786662 weather is unreliable 

> In 1871, 33 whaling ships, including two from Connecticut and a third with a Connecticut captain and owner, were trapped and crushed by pack ice off Alaska’s Arctic coast. They were only yards, and in some cases feet, away from shore. The whalers had counted on a wind shift driving the ice out to sea as it had done in the past, but the ice didn’t clear and they were forced to abandon their boats. More than 1,200 whalers, and in many cases their wives and family members, were stranded in unforgiving conditions, on a desolate section of beach stretching from Wainwright to Point Franklin in northern Alaska.

### id262786664 a single disaster can destroy an industry

> It was also a critical factor in the whaling industry’s decline. The story of the disaster has become part of whaling lore, the ships thought to be destroyed and lost for 144 years.

### id262786685 consumer demand can destroy populations

> The whaling industry as a whole was one of the biggest in the nation, with more than 2,700 whaleships prowling the ocean at its height. Though it was whale oil that lit the world’s lamps, the industry had a dark side. The unceasing consumer appetite for oil had led the mighty leviathans to be hunted to such an extent that, even by the end of the 1800s, their numbers were diminishing. In fact, it was the declining numbers that led to the first Arctic whaling expeditions.

### id262786835 shifting ice threatens ships

> However, danger was a constant, even in the best of times. Ships getting trapped by the shifting ice was not uncommon; more than 30 ships had been lost in the region between 1850 and 1871. In whaler lingo, getting wrecked by the ice was called being nipped.

### id262787071 arctic landscapes are variable 

> “I’ve seen islands pop up over a winter storm cycle; there’s a place where the boat can go one year and the next year there’s dirt in the same spot.”

### id262788440 arctic whalers traveled with their families

> Captain Williams of the Monticello decided he had had enough and attempted to leave the whaling waters, but struck ice and was grounded.
> 
> The next day, other whaling ships sent their crews to help the Monticello escape. Captain Williams’ son seemed unconcerned by the danger and remembered fondly the camaraderie of the whale crews who worked together to aid his father’s ship. “To me it was a gala day, the decks fairly swarmed with men, orders were executed with a snap and vigor that only a sailor can put into his work when he is pleased to.”
> But adults among the whaleships had begun to realize that failing to find whales might soon be the least of their problems. Newbury’s mood had clearly darkened. That same day, Aug. 30, he wrote, “Snowing hard; ice packed in close. Boats not returned. I have seen enough of Arctic whaling if this is a specimen.”

### id262788979 scouting parties help whaling fleets

> On Sept. 9, the captains of the fleet met. They realized it was likely their ships would not escape and they needed to move quickly in order to survive. Going to shore and enduring the winter in the barren region was a grim prospect, as they only had a few months’ provisions and no shelter.
> 
> The ships sent a scouting party via whaleboat, the much smaller and more maneuverable satellite vessels sent out to get whales within harpoon range. By a mixture of sailing, rowing and carrying these boats over bigger patches of ice, the scouting party reached largely open water and was able to find the other seven ships in the whale fleet, which were relatively safe from the ice. The scouts asked these ships to stay and assist with a rescue.

### id262789548 abandoning a sound ship is emotionally difficult 

> Even the generally upbeat William grew solemn when recounting the moment of abandonment. “I doubt if I can adequately describe the leave-taking of our ship,” he wrote. “The usual abandonment of a ship is the result of some irreparable injury and is executed in great haste; but here we were leaving a ship that was absolutely sound, that had been our home for nearly ten months and had taken us safely through many a trying time.”

> In the small whaleboats and by foot, 1,219 men, women and children embarked on a 70-mile trip to the waiting whaleships-turned-makeshift-rescue ships. Miraculously, everyone survived.

> To accommodate the shipwrecked whalers, the waiting whaleships had to empty their holds, giving up the precious cargo they had spent months or, in some cases, years accruing.

### id262789592 disaster destroyed the American whaling industry

> The disaster cost, in total of lost ships and cargo, more than $1.6 million in the currency of the day (nearly $48 million today). New Bedford, Massachusetts, was hit hardest, losing 22 ships. Few of the ships were replaced, as owners used the insurance money to get out of the already declining whaling industry and invest in textile mills or other less speculative enterprises.
> 
> Less fortunate were the captains who had abandoned their cargo to save the lives of their fellow seamen. It was 19 years before the U.S. government reimbursed them, but at that point it is doubtful the crews — who were normally paid a share of each voyage’s profits — were tracked down and given their share.
