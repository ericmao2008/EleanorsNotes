## Highlights
### Ritual tooth removal in Sudan

> In Sudan (Dinka, Nuer and Maban tribes) and especially in the rural villages of South-Saharan regions, people extract the lower incisors (and sometimes also the canines), shortly after their eruption, as a rite of passage, to enhance beauty, to show their tribal identity, to allow the emission of specific linguistic sounds and to facilitate oral sex
