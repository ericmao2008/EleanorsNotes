## Highlights

### q1

> This burial site was classified as being part of the Yamnaya horizon based on the burials rites of the people. These burials were '"pit graves" covered with an earthen mound. Just like with the Yamnaya. Furthermore, many of the people ad a supine position with flexed legs, similar to the positions seen with the Yamnaya. And the people buried here were sprinkled with red ochre, another tradition also prevalent in the Yamnaya horizon.

### q2

> We already know kurgan burials in the eneolithic were practised by non-Yamnaya peoples such as Steppe Maykop, and the ochre tradition is quite widespread as well.

### q3 

> What is interesting about the people here was that many of them were really big, sturdy people. Aside from the general robust features and all, several of the people here were well over 190 cm, reaching up to and above 2 meters tall! Given the sizes of the mounds these giants were buried in, archaeologists concluded that it is likely that these people were part of the upper strata of their society, perhaps as chieftains. But then you can ask a very interesting question: "Where they large because they were the highest tier of their society, or where they in the highest tier due to their large phyical stature?".

### q4

> this man standing at 2 meters tall was not a single case. There were several individuals his size at the burial site. Keep in mind that the samples we have were pretty much all relatives of one another, so you are likely looking at a burial site of a single tribe.
