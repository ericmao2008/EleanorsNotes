### p6 Bathsheba was powerful 

> Bathsheba, for instance, whose influence in the kingdom proves to be one of the most pivotal in the course of the history of the Davidic dynasty, first appears in the text in a compromised situation: her fate will either be that of the "great lady" (ה ָריִבְגּ), or that of the mother of a potential rival to the king—a dangerous position to be in.

I am interested in women of the bible, and I am interested in the kinds of power women had in the Ancient World. This is relevant for [[Phoenicia]] because Ancient Israel is a Caananite religion, and probably relevant to my [[marriage]] MOC.
