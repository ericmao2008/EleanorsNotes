## Highlights

### q1 locusts are driven off by rain

> “I have never seen anything like this. When the swarms of locust invaded, they consumed everything and all the vegetation was gone. The livestock had nothing to eat,” says the 32-year-old. In January, he had 80 goats. Today he has four.
> 
> Only seasonal rains have brought brief respite, forcing the insects to leave temporarily.

### q2 resource scarcity can break up families

> A Samburu herdsman, Leletit belongs to the semi-nomadic pastoralist community. Livestock are woven into the social fabric of life here; animals are an essential source of food, nutrition and financial security and the herders take great pride in their animals.
> 
> With a wife and four children to feed, after the first invasion he started growing leafy green vegetables and crops. But last week the locusts came back and ate them as well. Now he has been forced to send two children to live with his brother, and his four goats have moved in with a neighbour’s herd.

### q3

> A three-hour drive north-east of Isiolo, the centre of the recent desert locust invasion, the terrain around his village in Samburu county is much like 80% of Kenya’s landscape: dry, ideal for grazing animals but reliant on rain for crops.
> 
> Kenya is experiencing its worst locust invasion for 70 years.

### q4 economic insecure leads to violence

> Economic insecurity caused by the pandemic is already fuelling pastoralist attacks, she says. “There will be an increase in resource-based conflict … people will be moving towards areas where there will be grass. We need to prepare for conflict.”

### q5 pesticides can harm herds

> Erupe Lobun, a 40-year-old Turkana herder and father of 13 children, watches over an acacia-thorn cattle pen filled with baby goats. His home in Isiolo county was spared total devastation due to control efforts.
> 
> But he says his goats have become sick from the pesticide used to deter locusts. Some of the goats have bloated stomachs and can’t produce enough milk “because there’s not enough pasture”. It there is no milk, there will be nothing to eat, he says.

### q6

> Meanwhile, pastoralists such as Moses Lomooria, 34, from Isiolo county, are bracing for new enemies. Drought and disease are familiar, he says, and are slowly diminishing his herds. “This is just an additional burden. If the locusts feed on vegetation now, there will be no rain to bring it back until the end of the year.” The only thing he can do is wait.
