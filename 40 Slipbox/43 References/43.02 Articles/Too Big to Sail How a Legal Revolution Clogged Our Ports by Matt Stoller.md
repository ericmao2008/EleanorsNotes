### q1 laws can cause supply chain problems

> supply chain disruptions at the ports, and the Bill Clinton-era law that caused it

gives me an idea to do a mini prologue about the passage of a law, and then a ten years later thing where there's a short story addressing the unintended consequences. #fic/storyStem

### q2 misaligned incentives for ship size

> If ultra-large ships are so bad, then why do we use them? As is often the case, this business trend started with a good idea, which then was turned horribly wrong by unregulated monopolization. In the 1960s, ‘containerization’ - or standardizing the flow of cargo on shipping containers that can go over ships, rail, or truck - made shipping far more efficient. And with containerization came the growth in ship size, because larger ships can carry more stuff at a lower cost per container. As ship sizes gradually increased from the 1960s into the 1990s, shipping prices declined, and world trade boomed.
> Starting in the 2000s, increases in ship size accelerated. But once you go from big ships to Empire State Building size ones, cost savings are minimal, and diseconomies of scale kick in. Efficiency gains from newer generations of mega-ships are four to six times lower than previous generations, and 60% of that gain has to do with better engines, not size. Ultra-large ships can be harder to steer, they create massive instability in scheduling, and they require lots of extra infrastructure. Loading and unloading containers for these behemoths can only be done at a small number of ports, and if a mega-ship is early or late, it can create what is in effect a traffic jam. And that’s what’s happening en masse.

### q3 infrastructure is hard to fix 

> I’ve talked to business leaders who have already planned to re-shore production, and politicians are [beginning](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/opinion/hawley-supply-chain-trade-policy.html) the conversation about policies to make that happen. But there is no consensus why the transportation grid is so inflexible, especially in the U.S. It just seems like a giant tangled up mess.

### q4 recessions originated with railroads

> There’s a strong argument that the first modern recessions in industrializing nations happened in the early 1800s as a result of the cyclicality of the railroad business.

### q5 labor problems in shipping are complicated

> Despite the argument there’s a ‘trucker shortage,’ in California, one firm [specializing](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/truckers-tired-of-taking-blame-for-congestion-crisis-at-california-ports?utm_source=sfmc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=FW_Daily_11_3_21&utm_term=Truckers+tired+of+taking+blame+for+congestion+crisis+at+California+ports&utm_id=72965&sfmc_id=63556858) in trucking from ports (‘drayage’) is actually *laying off truckers* because they simply can’t get to the terminals to load or unload containers.

### q6 pinch points benefit the few at the costs of the many

> Both carriers and terminal operators are bottlenecks in the system, and they profit not just by charging normal prices, but also by imposing a variety of [surcharges](http:// https://www.itf-oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/impact-alliances-container-shipping.pdf ) on anyone who needs their service. This is similar to how airlines will offer a price for a ticket, but then also charge baggage fees, ticket change fees, or administrative fees on top of that. In 2009, for instance, roughly 50% of total freight charged came from surcharges. The ability to extract extra revenue, especially [when demand is high](https://www.joc.com/port-news/us-ports/port-los-angeles/pierpass-doubles-la-lb-port-daytime-truck-fee-push-night-moves_20211111.html), means that we’re not in an all-hands on deck situation, but a situation which is working quite well for some, and terribly for much of the industry and the public.

### q7 monopolies control bottlenecks 

> a monopolist in some sense be defined as a firm that drives its profit model by capturing control over a bottleneck, like a toll booth.

### q8 resiliency is short-term inefficient 

> “Modern finance with its obsession with ‘Return on Equity,’” meaning the kind of financial models that prioritize hyper-efficiency over all forms of resiliency. Most leaders, Peterson said, “stripped their company of all but the bare minimum of assets. Just in time everything. No excess capacity. No strategic reserves. No cash on the balance sheet. Minimal R&D.” The shock absorbers of the economy, he argued, are gone.

[[Backwards Mapping Fiction]] this reminds me of the Modesitt concept in the Imager series where they burn the factory enemy.

### q9 laws have consequences 

> But there is a specific *policy* choice that led to the mess Peterson is explaining. Why did we build these unstable, just-in-time supply chains run on ultra-large ships and mediated by monopolies and private equity firms? The answer is, as usual, found in law. In the 1990s, Congress, at the behest of large importers and giant shipping lines, drove a radical change in how we regulate shipping, through a bill called the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998.
> The OSRA eliminated a system that had kept shipping relatively stable through booms and busts. Prior to the OSRA, the U.S. regulated ocean shipping as a public utility, based on the [Shipping Act](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Shipping_Act_1917_and_the_Joint_Resu/UfgTAAAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22shipping+act%22+antitrust&pg=PA31&printsec=frontcover) of 1916.

There are probably a jillion things I can cross-reference this with.

### q10

> With destructive competition, entire high fixed cost industries first over-invest in capacity. Then firms become unprofitable as they undercut one another, undermining safety standards, system reliability, and worker pay. Eventually there are mass bankruptcies of weaker firms, and consolidation as the strong buy the weak and establish pricing power. That’s what happened with railroads in the 19th century and airlines in the 1980s. The remaining firms became monopolistic, cut less trafficked routes, raised prices, and discriminated against different classes and regions. (One of the most violent labor uprisings in American history, in 1877, occurred because such ‘ruinous competition’ among railroads led to mass cuts in worker pay).

### q11 transparency helps identify problems

> Transparency in pricing helps everyone identify problems immediately. That’s what the Shipping Act did for ocean carriers. It stabilized the industry.
> But starting in the 1970s, policymakers turned away from the basic public utility model in multiple industries, including trucking, rail, telecommunications, finance, and airlines. Prices indeed went down at first, seeming to prove the efficiency experts correct. But long-term, the change led to destructive competition in these sectors. Airlines, for instance, expanded rapidly and then went bankrupt, in turn cutting labor costs, ending air service to smaller and medium sized cities, and then consolidated into an oligopoly with pricing power. (This is still going on, by the way. United [just announced](https://www.businessinsider.com/united-airlines-canceled-routes-airline-deregulation-act-2021-11) it is cutting more flights to small towns across the midwest.) There were similar changes in the rail and trucking sectors.

Reminds me of the postal service problems — it NEEDS to be a public utility so that ALL PEOPLE CAN BE SERVED.

### q12 effective antitrust enforcement requires transparency 

> From 1995-1998, Congress debated how to get rid of the public utility framework around shipping, with the encouragement of the Clinton administration. The key change they settled on was to eliminate the transparency provisions of the Shipping Act by allowing secret deals between ocean carriers and shippers, while retaining the antitrust exemption. Now carriers could discriminate against smaller exporters or importers, they could retaliate against anyone who complained or used a competitor, they could price-gouge without anyone knowing about it, and antitrust enforcers and regulators basically had to stand aside.

### q13 monopolies stress transportation grids 

> During the debate over the law, small shippers were apoplectic. “This bill,” [said](https://www.google.com/books/edition/S_1356_Ocean_Shipping_Reform_Act_of_1995/_2XxB8LvOEEC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22ocean+shipping+reform+act%22&pg=PA302&printsec=frontcover) Geoffrey Giovanetti of the Wine and Spirits Shippers’ Association, “guarantees that the real marketplace in ocean shipping will be completely confidential shipping contracts to which no regulatory or legal constraints will apply.” The longshoremen similarly attacked deregulation, with the President of the International Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Union saying that the bill would allow “large carriers and huge multi-national shippers easily and purposefully agree to bypass entire port communities in an attempt to monopolize the market and inflate profits.” There were warnings that the American fleet would disappear, that a boom and bust cycle would return, that dominant carriers would emerge, that the transportation grid would be stressed, and that the small would become prey for the big.

### q14 Clinton administration encouraged deregulation

> the tide of deregulation, heavily supported by the Clinton administration, was too powerful to resist.

### q15

> The American shipping fleet disappeared, and U.S. shipping is now run by foreign ocean carriers (one of which is controlled by the Chinese government).

### q16

> U.S. agricultural exporters gradually lost access to shipping, because the shipping oligopoly made more money returning empty containers to Asia than filling them with bulk commodities from the U.S.

Another classic [[Misaligned Incentives]] example.

### 17 transparency is important for infrastructure efficiency 

> To address the immediate crisis, the Biden administration has [pushed ports](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJwtkcGOhCAMhp9muGkAUcYDh73sa5iKlSGLYKCu8e0XZ5aQ_uGH0vJhgdClfBnCQmxPhSa6djQRzxKQCDM7CubJL4Ythmtp9cx8mdaMuIEPhu3HHLwF8inep4TopWIv80QhgY92lTPoXmHHlUIAGPq-kxrGTy04Fo_RokkxXNMOfmHBvIj28ui-HvK7zvM82_PlCV-pdtK69FvNOXtcfXRNTmm71yG5KpJLUUW8A68ho8VIzZ6Ty1hKA3FpwN69libFZk-ZGpuiq4-vXk1g3tyX1NHxTmguWtkqvc6rHgdYh95aeLb9QAXWq38ovjnRlmMuBPantWlj2RRKIWCum-4m9HYrpKnqdkRP14QR5oCLoXwgow_6N83JYcRcv2SZgIwYukHrTkmpBvHhVQGrjuvnyEdWyy6pZkWzAdF_1T-dbp1T) to offload boxes faster (with incredible whining from the carriers), and is seeking investment in port infrastructure. Congress should get involved, and investigate the shipping industry the way it did big tech a few years ago. To this end, restoring transparency in pricing across the board by making most contracts and pricing public would help problems and bottlenecks become apparent.

### q18

> Of course, we can’t undo 20 years of ultra-large container ship construction, but we can end incentives for [building more of them](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJw1UcGynSAM_RrZ6QiiPBcsOu3rposu-gFOhOhliuBA7Kv9-qK2wCQkOeEMJwYI15hOTZiJ7THTROeOOuBH9kiEiR0Z0-SsZla3Shg1M5enJSFu4Lxm-zF7Z4BcDBeK815I9tK2m6Fv5SB6qbgANQppW8klqHJfRvFwwWEdBoM6Bn9OOzjLvH4R7bnqPlXiazmrgZ3AhcbErYQxWUy53nCF2sRwVTDV-eX2XFvMuyOs84F_7ubuekW9F0v4m6ruy7eYECrRi_ZH6ZgP560L6524zHDfvi9LfhXgHbyHtTBg-g-DYCvx-cN5f4fzg7Lo3S9MaJ_kebuye-Z0cbysru24ankjGqmWeVHjAMvQGwNvTT9QhuXsK9luK2_yMWcC8_P6MUs6U_QeUymul-J3tog-Fb8dwdE5YYDZo9WUDmT0jPKezrRiUaeM2E5Amg_doFQnhZADf_QvA5Ndq97GdmSF1sbSFfQGRP9Y_wJlnLJj) by charging harbor maintenance fees based on ship size, or otherwise forcing carriers to internalize the full cost of big ships. This will have to be on a national scale, with the threat of antitrust, so carriers can’t play U.S. ports off one another.

This feels like a useful method for a character in a book focused on infrastructure to use.
