## Highlights

### q1 the first German walls were to protect against Rome

> within Germania different tribal groups would compete with each other over the access to Roman markets and trade. This kicked off some proto-state formation within Germania itself, and the first evidence of walled cities in Germania date to this time, between the campaigns of Germanicus and the later Marcommanic wars.
