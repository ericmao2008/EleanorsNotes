### id283952884 Roman military stopped sponsoring temple construction

 > emperors of the late third century CE came from this social milieu, and their disposition  toward temples would have been affected by their experiences during military service.  I demonstrate here how and why support for temple construction, repair, and expansion  among the military communities in two of the most militarized provinces, Britain and  Pannonia, decreased dramatically after the early third century and why certain temples  (Mithraea and Dolichena) did not similarly decline. This examination also reveals how  the changing relationship between military communities and temples influenced the attitudes of late third-century emperors toward temple construction and repair.

### id283953065 being a Roman town councillor declined in attractiveness

 > in order to join the local town council,  one was obliged to fund the construction and repair of  public buildings, often including temples, for the benefit of the community. This wealth requirement meant  that membership of town councils was only open to a  select few in Roman society, yet, from the third century CE on, serving as a town councillor became less  attractive as a career path, and there is a consequent  decline in euergetism.

### id283953902 soldiers are agents for spreading culture

 , soldiers  are often presented as the foremost agents in the spread  of Roman culture,8 which in the northwest provinces  included the construction of structures to house religious practices.

### id283953908 the relative pay of Roman soldiers decreased in the 3rd century BCE

> investment in the  construction and repair of temples associated with the  military community in Britain and Pannonia changed  from the end of the first century CE to the early fourth  century. Evidence provided here shows that, in both  provinces, there was a drastic reduction in financial  support for temples connected to the military community during the third to early fourth centuries and that  the possible factors leading to this decline consist of:  the absence of direct imperial stimulus following the  Severan period; the difficulty faced by soldiers in supporting such projects when garrisons were reduced in  size or the soldiers’ relative pay decreased; the changing nature of euergetism in Roman society; and the  trend away from using temples to demonstrate a relationship with the divine in a military environment.  Finally, the article explores why temples dedicated to  Mithras and Jupiter Dolichenus (commonly referred  to as Mithraea and Dolichena) continued to be built  and repaired, and how their continuing popularity led  to the Tetrarchs’ unprecedented decision to fund the  repair of a Mithraeum at Carnuntum.

### id283953910 Roman forts could host most religious functions

 > Finally, it is possible that, beginning in the early third  century, spaces within forts were adapted to accommodate religious activities but these adapted spaces are  not archaeologically visible. The Dolichenum inside  the fort at Vindolanda and the Mithraeum inside the  tribune’s house at the Aquincum fort indicate that, although a rarity, it was possible for unofficial religious  spaces (i.e., other than the shrine of the standards) to  be installed in forts.

> If, as was postulated  above, temples were increasingly viewed as superfluous among military communities, then there would be  little reason to continue conducting rituals outside the  forts. However, the conversion of spaces inside forts to  a religious use is not easily detectable.

### id283953921 small congregations have higher engagement

 > As sociological studies have demonstrated,  such circumstances, in which congregations are kept  relatively small, generate a particularly high level of  commitment among the congregation members, as  the small size allows them to build social bonds with  a significant percentage of their fellow worshippers,  unlike in congregations numbering in the hundreds  or thousands.98  Furthermore, one’s commitment to a  group can be enhanced by repetitive participation in  ritual activities, especially initiations.

### id283953926 initiation rites create strong social bonds

 > A prospective  Mithraic initiate would need to have complete faith  in his fellow Mithras worshippers, as he would be  stripped naked, bound, and have perhaps a sword, a  bow and arrow, or a torch waved in front of his face.100  Prospective members would be completely at the  mercy of the congregation and could only pass the  initiation by placing their trust in those around them.  Particularly in a military community, membership in  a Mithraic congregation provided another social bond  among soldiers who already spent much time eating,  sleeping, training, and fighting beside one another. It  is not difficult to see how a group of soldiers who attended a local Mithraeum might band together to pay  for its refurbishment while their enthusiasm to support  other religious buildings waned.

### id283953954 initiation rites dependent on temples encourage temple maintenance  

 > The initiation ceremony symbolized the descent  and return of the initiate’s soul through the cosmos,  a journey that included passing through the various  celestial gates marked out by the iconography of the  Mithraeum. While other cults could continue to conduct at least some of their rituals without temples, this  was not possible for the cult of Mithras, for the space  created by the Mithraeum and the rituals conducted  in this space were deeply intertwined. For the cult to  continue, Mithraea had to be maintained, and that is  what we see in the archaeological evidence. Indeed,  it is striking that in some locations, such as Poetovio  and Aquincum, when the civilian towns had been  largely abandoned toward the end of the fourth century, Mithraea in these locations were still being used,  an indication that people were making a journey to  these particular spaces, perhaps across a considerable  distance. The form of the rituals conducted in these  Mithraea had changed by this time, with considerable  numbers of coins now deposited in them as offerings,  but these spaces clearly retained a special importance  for people that other neighboring structures, religious  or secular, did not.

### id283954025 Roman infrastructure investment declined in the third century 

 > Second, among rank-and-file soldiers,  it was increasingly harder to pay for the construction or  repair of buildings when the value of a soldier’s pay was  significantly reduced and the smaller size of garrisons  made group efforts to fund building projects more difficult. Although commanding officers probably still  had the means to invest in such projects, they chose  not to do so, possibly because of the general decline  in public munificence during the third century. Third,  the central rituals of the army (sacrifices, oaths, and  festivals) never required a temple, thus such structures  were not intrinsic to the religious behavior expected of  members of the military community.

### id283954026 the Mithras cult required a temple to function

> This can be explained in part by the small size of  these temples, which made them less costly than larger  temples. In the case of the Mithras cult, its organization, which fostered a significant level of commitment  among its members, generated continuing support  for the construction and repair of Mithraea. Because  the specific building design of Mithraea was integral  to Mithraic rituals, maintenance of these temples was  imperative for the cult. In this respect, the Mithras cult  differed from other religious groups, even other initiatory cults, which had significant public dimensions to  their worship and could conduct at least some of their  rituals out in the open.
