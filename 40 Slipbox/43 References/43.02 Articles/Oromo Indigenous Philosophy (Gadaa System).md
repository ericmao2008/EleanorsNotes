### p10 the Oromo under the Gadaa successfully fought Muslim and Christian empires

> For many scholars, Oromo history began in the 16th century when the Oromo were actively recapturing their territories and rolling back the Christian and Muslim empires. At that time Oromo people had a form of constitutional government known as Gadaa. During the 16th and 17th century, when various peoples were fighting over economic resources in the Horn of Africa, the Oromo were effectively organized under the Gadaa institution for both offensive and defensive wars

Gadaa system is a type of [[age-sets|age-set]] system.

### p10 the Gadaa system still exists today in a reduced, ritualized form

> The Gadaa system still helps in maintaining peace, and transmitting knowledge, and practicing rituals between some moieties and groups in Gujii and Borena Oromia. Under such conditions, it is very difficult for Gadaa officials to meet, discuss and decide developed social and economic problem and power transfer. As a result of these factors the political culture of the Oromo was restricted and Gadaa was reduced to ritual system

### p11 Gadaa is just one sociopolitical system the Oromo used 

> The Oromo nations have developed different systems of governance in their history. Among such governments, Gadaa System is the most comprehensive system of political, legal, religious and social system of the Oromo society. Gadaa is an indigenous socio-political system "that regulated political stability, economic development, social activities, cultural obligations, moral responsibility, and the philosophy of religious order of the society". It is controversial among scholars when and how the indigenous Oromo Gadaa system emerged

### p11 the Gadaa system began as a religious system and then expanded into social, economic, and political aspects

> Oromo oral tradition also supports in the early days, Gadaa was purely a religious institution that helped the society as a constitution later it came to bind the Socio-economic, political and religious life of Oromo. The political philosophy of Gadaa has "principles of checks and balances, terms of eight years, balanced opposition between parties, and power sharing" to prevent power from falling into the hands of dictators. Other principles of the system have included balanced representation of all clans, lineages, regions and confederacies

### p11 there are 5 political parties under the Gadaa system among the Gujii 

> Thus, political, legal, cultural, social and religious administrative activities in the Gadaa System planned, organized, staffed, directed, coordinated, and reported by these channels of social settings. In the political structure of Gujii Gadaa system there are five miseensaa (parties). These five parts includes Muudaana, Halchiisa,Dhallaana, Harmufa and Roobalee.

### p11-12 

> Abbaa Gadaa's of Gujii are ranked in terms of their birth order. By the virtue of his seniority, the Abbaa Gadaa of Uraagaa is taken as the major (President) of the Guji Society. On the other hand, in the Gadaa governance system, the Qaalluu institution (religious institution) was significant in the check and balance of power. 

### p12 religious leaders direct transfer of power every 8 years

> The primary role of Qaalluu's (religious leaders) was offering religious leadership in the religion of Waaqeffanna. Qaalluu used to direct Gadaa initiation ceremonies, handover power and Muudaa ceremony. "Muudaa ceremony is a ceremony performed every eight years when all elected Gada officials paid visit to the Qaalluu and get blessing and recognitions for their next leadership.

### p12 

> Muudaa ceremony was regarded as a graduation time for those who entered the Luba

The Luba is the "incoming" group. See also: [[#p17 Gadaa summarized]]

### p12

> In other words, Abbaa Bokkuu was a chief executive in the Gadaa assembly. According to G. W. B. Hunting ford "The Abbaa Bokkuu and his two colleagues are chosen from the most distinguished families known as ' Hayyuu.' The principal function of the Abbaa Bokkuu is to preside over the parliament ... to proclaim the laws, and to act when necessary as ritual expert in the Gadaa-ceremonies." Abba Gadaa is another name for Abbaa Bokkuu. The Abbaa Bokkuu was also supported by a council, known as Salgee, and retired Gadaa officials. This might happen among Gadaa parties starting from lower level of Gadaa and through higher active and passive stages. Another character of Gadaa system of governance is it does not depends on property, social classes etc.

### p12 qualities considered in leaders 

> In electing leaders "there is a general understanding among the electors and the men competing for offices to be Abbaa Gadaa. These are past military achievements, Oratorical talent, mystical attributes,wisdom for settling dispute,traditional knowledge about the societyandhis Potential for future leadershipis the most important factors to be considered 

### p12 Siiqqee is the female parall to the Gadaa system

> In precolonial Oromo society, women had the Siiqqee institution, a parallel institution to the Gadaa system that "functioned hands in hand with Gadaa system as one of its built-in mechanisms of checks and balances." These two institutions helped to maintain Safuuin Oromo society by enabling Oromo women to have control over resources and private matters, social status and respect, and sisterhood and solidarity bypreventing men from infringing upon their rights

### p12 the Guihii Oromo used an [[age-sets]] system

> male members of Gujii Oromo are grouped into age grade "hiriyaa" (peer) system.

### p12

> In Oromo society, knowledge and information have been mainly transmitted from generation to generation through the institutions of family, religion, and Gadaa. Dabballees are expected to learn appropriate social behavior from their families, communities and experts. Dabballee is a productive time to study Oromo myth, riddles(Hibboo), stories of different types, geerersa, cultural songs. Qarree duubaa stage is the most important stage in the Gadaa cycle when the members shoulder family responsibilities and engage in military exercise. In other words, this period was the period of enjoyment and military training. In domestic life, they engaged in how to prepare and use plowing materials in agriculture, utilization of property, family management and social life by

### p14

> According to Gujii Gadaa structure Gumii is the general assembly that the previous laws are revised and new legislations were introduced by the Gadaa council every eight years. Accordingly, a well-known community leaders, key informants and prominent Gadaa leaders of Gujii communities were fully interviewed primarily on procedures and practice the transition of Gadaa power

### p17 Gadaa summarized

> Gadaa is an indigenous socio-political system that regulated Political stability, Economic development, Social activities, Cultural obligations, Moral responsibility, and the philosophy of religious order of the Oromo society. In Gujii Gadaa system there are Muudaana, Halchiisa, Dhallaana, Harmufa and Roobalee parties. These five party systems are the operational mechanism of the Gadaa cycle. Gumii Bokkoo is Gujii social assembly of the Gujii confederacy (Uraagaa, Maattii and Hookkuu) held every eight years at a place Me'ee Bokkoo. It composed of Haaganaa Saglan comprising Gadaa, Doorii and Raaba from Uraagaa, Maattii and Hookkuu. During this Gumii assembly, different indigenous laws proclaimed, amended and rehearsed. As Gujii Oromo elders narrate, Baallii transfer may not change unless the country faces natural or manmade problems such as dislocation of people, war, famine, drought etc. The term office of the elected Gadaa leaders was limited to eight years and ending with a formal power transfer ceremony called Baallii. Power was transferred from one party to other party peacefully through fair and free and periodic election. Baallii Ceremony was a transitional ceremony that involved large feasting and extensive ritual activities. It was a period when the strength of the incoming Gadaa members (Luba) was tested and it was a time when incoming Gadaa class took the socio-political and religious power from the outgoing Gadaa class. The transfer of power was carried out when the legal expert transferred the Baallii Guchii (ostrich feather) from the outgoing Abbaa Gadaa to the incoming one. The two parties exchanged milk and blessings. Then the one who takes power accepted the 'Eebbaa' (blessing) through handing over seven 'Daraara'. It confirms the existence of peace, and respect between giving and taking power of Gadaa and ambition of the same by taking Abbaa Gadaa in his Gadaa reign.
