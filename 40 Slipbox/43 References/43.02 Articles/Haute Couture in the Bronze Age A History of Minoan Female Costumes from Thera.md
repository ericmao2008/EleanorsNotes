# Summary
summary:: Minoan Thera is similar to Roman Pompeii in that it was preserved due to a volcanic explosion. It describes Minoan clothing design, but more importantly covers how some common conceptions about the [[Bronze Age]] are wrong.

### p13 Minoan Thera is similar to Roman Pompeii

> the destruction of Thera created a freeze-frame in which Minoan life and material culture was preserved. [...]
> Similar to Roman Pompeii, the excavators dug into private houses and discovered preserved furniture, cooking ware and amazing frescoes on the walls. 

### p13 Minoan clothing design  

> The female Minoan costume seems to be composed of a tight bodice, sometimes openfronted and with short sleeves. The bodice is decorated on the edges, either with bands or in-woven decorative motifs. The skirt can be bell-shaped or flounced, and is often decorated with either woven stripes or bands. [...]
> Tassels hang from the sleeve edges or around the waist

### p16 Coloring Clothes 

> People of the Bronze Age could obtain variegated shades or patterns with the naturally pigmented black, brown or white wool. However, in the Bronze Age, it is likely that through selective breeding people could increase the production of white wool and this gave great opportunities for an amazing explosion of colours in dress. Textiles were dyed with plant and animal dyes.

### p18 Tyrian purple doesn't need as many snails as people think

> the Minoans did not necessarily need the pure substance for their textiles (Burke 1999). A strong, vivid, and colourfast colour can be obtained with much less murex. This technical misunderstanding, combined with the Theran frescoes and the knowledge of Roman extravagance have contributed to the idea of the Minoan culture as being luxurious and sophisticated. Roots from the madder plant can also be used for red dyes. We are less sure about the blue colours, but it was probably obtained from woad. The yellow could be obtained from either saffron or safflower flowers. On the Theran frescoes, women gather saffron and we know from the Late Bronze Age inscriptions that safflower was cultivated on palace land, most probably for dye substances to be used in the textile industry.


### p18 silk outside of China

> An intact silk cocoon was found on Thera, and some carved seals depict moths. This may indicate the use of silk already in the Bronze Age.

### p19 palace textile creation

> In the so-called First Palace period, about 2000-1700 BC, textile production was mainly a household activity, but the rising powers of the Minoan palaces required a more specialised production, in particular for gift exchange and creating networks between palaces within the Minoan culture and with foreign powers

### p19 textile creation was specialized much earlier than previously believed

> the archaeological evidence from Thera actually conflicts with the traditional idea of ancient textile production being carried out everywhere and by everyone. [...]
> Iris Tzachili suggests that textile production at Akrotiri operated in a context involving some kind of women's cooperative, similar to a guild, in which the duties and profits would have been shared, possibly according to the skills of the participants. She makes a stimulating comparison with the fresco of the saffron gatherer (Fig. 1.1): here several women work individually, but collect saffron in similar baskets and deliver the flowers to a collective basket (Tzachili 2007).

I've never heard of Bronze Age co-ops before-I love the idea that "Medieval guilds" aren't newï¼ŸI could use this as an "older than you think " or "not anachronistic" [[Article & Blog Idea]].
