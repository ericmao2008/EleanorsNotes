![[Review How To Invent Everything by Alex Irpan#id261667802 irradiating plants and molds is effective]]
- [n] I remember reading about this in [[Tamed by Alice Roberts]], but with different details. Would be useful for #pkm/xref
- [n] [[Backwards Mapping Fiction]] for [[Starship Troopers]] by [[Robert Heinlein]] I remember something about the planet they wound up on not having enough radiation to create really competitive plants.
