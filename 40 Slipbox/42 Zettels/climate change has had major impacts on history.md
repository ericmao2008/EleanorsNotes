Climate change may not be a new phenomenon but that's no reason not to take it seriously â€” we know a lot about the impacts of climate degradation in history, and they're never good for the civilization causing the problem! 
 
 Horses were likely domesticated due to climate change, because horses were better at finding food in winters with lots of snow and ice. Their herds work similarly to cattle, which were domesticated far earlier. Besides which, a decline in easily hunted game might have necessitated [[domestication]] since it allowed humans to have a more stable food source. 
 
## Rant

 If your response to the devastation caused by Harvey is to say "this would have happened without humans" as if it MATTERS whether or not climate change is caused by humans, you have utterly missed the point.
 
It's happening, and people are going to die if we don't take steps to deal with it.

Steps like, idk, making sure infrastructure is built with flood potential in mind. Like not destroying barrier islands and wetlands. Like ensuring disaster relief is organized and competent.

"This isn't out fault!" will be cold comfort as the sea levels rise and temperatures spiral out of control, causing more and more wild climate events.

Because not once have I heard a climate-denier argue that it's not actually, you know, changing, and I'll even grant that there have been (less severe) climate changes previously in history that may or may not have been caused by human actions.

But what I don't understand is why that seems like a sound argument, like the people of Europe weren't utterly devastated by the Little Ice Age. Half of Iceland's population died. Entire colonies were wiped out. Technology changed drastically to cope with the increasing cold. Famines broke out due to the failure to change farming practices to account for the shorter growing seasons, and the loss of arable land.

Climate change disrupts human populations. THAT can't be argued with.

I don't CARE whether people caused global warming or not (except insofar as the fact that we ARE causing it gives us the necessary clues to know how to stop making it worse).

But can we please stop pretending we don't have to do anything in reaction to it?
