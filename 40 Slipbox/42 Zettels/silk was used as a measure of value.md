	- [I] I read a couple more pages that gave detailed trade values for various measures of silk. I don't have a totally clear view on how big a bolt of silk was, but it was definitely used as a measure of value and the book explains the exact price, which could be useful for the [[Uskune trade fair]] and establishing the relative wealth of the [[Monche Nomads]], although how a nomadic people would store such wealth is a bit beyond me. #research to figure out more about the logistics there.
