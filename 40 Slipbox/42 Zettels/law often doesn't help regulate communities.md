[Book Review: Order Without Law at Astral Codex Ten](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-order-without-law) %% [[reviewierOrderWithoutLaw2021]] %% came up in conversation discussing talking about how useless “the law” and courts can be at solving disputes that harm a small business, i.e. if Obsidian shared their code under a restrictive license they couldn’t enforce the license so it’s useful, similar to teaching and parenting where [[a rule that isn’t enforced won’t be followed]]. The article is a good overview of how utterly at odds with the realities of how communities handle conflict "the law" can be. Also relevant for [[hard cases make bad law]] because people tend to ignore bad or silly laws as long as there isn’t a case of [[Misaligned Incentives]].
