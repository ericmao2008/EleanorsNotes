## Highlights

### Aztecs used cloth armor

> we don’t know the exact equipment of each Aztec military order, but they definitely wore armour.
>
> The basis of the armour was cotton, and it was effective enough to deter even European weapons.
>
> The Aztecs did use actual jaguar skins, but these were most likely reserved for rituals. In other words, it was part of, what we would call today, the dress uniform.
>
> We have some depictions of Aztec war suits, mainly from the Codex Mendoza. Here are some [pics](https://www.google.com/search?q=Aztec+warriors+codex+mendoza&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi-qryk-PfyAhVJeH0KHW2DCDUQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1920&bih=969)

> basic body armour was the ichcahuipilli, which was basically a cotton shirt about two fingers thick. For elite warriors this was then covered by a tlahuiztli, which was a cotton war costume, decorated with feathers. This armour was also made out of cotton, although it was less padded. This gave less protection, but still allowed for the extremities to move flexibly. Warriors also wore padded leggings and arm braces, also made from cotton (or possibly deer leather). Elite commanders wore an ehuatl, or feathered tunic, in place of a war suit, although it is not exactly clear why. Armour was reinforced with metals, leather, and possibly even wood (I think cane may have been used for this purpose, but cannot confirm it). As for helmets, the wooden animal helms have already been mentioned. However, most soldiers seems to have worn a conical, cotton helmet, which is commonly depicted in the codices. John Pohl’s Aztec Warrior has some good illustrations of what the equipment may have looked like. Exact style of course, would have varied between different regions, and over time.
