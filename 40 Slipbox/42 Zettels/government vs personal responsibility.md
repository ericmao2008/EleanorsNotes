It's easy to say "we all have a personal responsibility to behave better online" and also easy to say "the government should regulate online spaces to make them safer and healthier" but fundamentally, _we_ need to _change society_ and that's really hard. 

it takes a propaganda campaign, maybe? 

The USA can't even convince people to wear masks or get a vaccine, how can we possibly expect to have consensus on online policy :/

Diffuse responsibility and impact can be dangerous (apparently [[Scott Alexander]] said this in his FDA piece); there's a study about how to keep your stuff safe at the beach, and the idea is to ask a specific individual to do it, don't just ask "someone" to watch your stuff â€” as a teacher, I know that it's less effective to say "can someone go get the principal" than it is to delegate a random individual to do the task. 

Leadership is hard, but letting people play "it's not my fault" can be just as dangerous as outright tyranny, if we're judging by the metric of lives lost. #nonfic/articleseed/afterword
