Listening to LYT and Obsidian Office Hours on youtube was the impetuous for me realizing what ADHD people mean when they say that they focus better when they've got something going on the background -- having them on in the background keeps me from alt+tabbing when I get bored with what I'm doing and they aren't too distracting to keep me from working on what I was working on.

 music has always helped me focus but I always had trouble understanding (not believing, just understanding) my students (and programmers I know) who say they think better with a movie on. I usually get hella distracted by tv shows and movies, no matter how bad.
