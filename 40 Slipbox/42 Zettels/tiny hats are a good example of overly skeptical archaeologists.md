The people of the Andes mountains war hats that archaeologists thought were quite small and probably would have said we're too small to actually be worn by people if they haven't been discovered on actual memes which is something that I kind of find ridiculous given the existence of tiny Victorian hats and other hats that require hot pins in order to secure to the hair another example of small hats are the skull caps worn by a Jewish men or the Caps worn over the tonsures of bald men. 

Instantly done incidentally I've done exactly zero research on this but I have always wondered whether the monkish habit of shaving that bulge patch was done to emulate the natural balding patterns of old men in order to indicate wisdom in the same way that we often associate beards with adulthood the manliness because it's a fairly natural phenomenon.
