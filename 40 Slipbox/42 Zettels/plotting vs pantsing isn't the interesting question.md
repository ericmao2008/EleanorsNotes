# [Is "plotting vs. pantsing" even real?](https://losapala.medium.com/what-pantsing-really-means-and-why-most-writers-have-it-all-wrong-a6430d6a5c79)

I feel like there are people who impose a story structure first, people who structure their story last, people who structure their story iteratively, and people who don't structure their story at all. Although some people structure their stories instinctively, and others do it explicitly, most of the people who don't structure their story \*at all\* don't get published.
