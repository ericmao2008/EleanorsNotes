- [?] Was the point of sati (suttee) to follow one's husband, in his social role as head of the household, related at all to the [[The Civilizations of Africa by Christopher Ehret#ch04p158 Human Sacrifice|Sudanic notion of sacral kingship]]? 
- [?] If there's no clear linkage in terms of literal diffusion of culture (and I don't expect there would be), what does that say about humans as a species? 
- [?] Does this relate at all to the Terracotta Army in [[China]]? 
- [I] I feel like there's a very strong similarity between this idea, the [[Scythian]] burial practices where [[2020.09.07 Tombs|tombs]] would involve the bodies of the dead as well as the sacrifice of the deceased's favorite horse(s).
