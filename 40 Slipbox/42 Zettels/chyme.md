> Chyme or chymus is the semi-fluid mass of partly digested food that is expelled by a person's stomach, through the pyloric valve, into the duodenum. Chyme results from the mechanical and chemical breakdown of a bolus and consists of partially digested food, water, hydrochloric acid, and various digestive enzymes.
