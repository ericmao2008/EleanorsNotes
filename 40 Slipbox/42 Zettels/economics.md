* [[Brotherhood of Kings by Amanda Podany#Syria was a clearinghouse for the Far East trade and diplomacy]]
* [[Human-Animal Entanglements in the Neolithic]] covers the mixed hunter/gatherer + agriculture/herding economies of neolithic towns. 
* [[The Horse The Wheel And Language by David Anthony#ch09p191 Cows Social Power and the Emergence of Tribes]] -- stockbreeding is a volatile economy in which herders who lose animals borrow from those who have animals. 
## Raw Dumps
* [[David Graeber Economics]] is a discussion I had with someone in discord where I fundamentally disagree with stuff that David Graeber has to say about economics because the original presentation seemed painfully Eurocentric.
