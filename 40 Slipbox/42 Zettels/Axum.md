# The Aksumite Empire

An ancient kingdom located in modern-day Ethopia that existed from roughly 80 BCE to 825 CE. The polity was centered in the city of Axum and grew from the proto-Aksumite Iron Age period around the 4th century BC to achieve prominence by the 1st century AD. Aksum became a major player on the commercial route between the [[Roman]] Empire and Classical [[India]]. 

The Aksumite rulers facilitated trade by minting their own Aksumite [[2021.01.11 Currency|currency]], with the state establishing its hegemony over the declining Kingdom of [[Kush]]. 

Axum was one of the four great powers of its time, the others being [[Persia]], Rome and [[China]]. [^1]
