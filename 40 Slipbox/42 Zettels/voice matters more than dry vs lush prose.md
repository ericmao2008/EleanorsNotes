[Which is better: dry, minimalist prose or lush, lyrical prose?](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/9b2ngm/minimalism_vs_purple_prose_thoughts/)
```

I prefer whichever style suits the pov character / narrator best. I prefer prose that has strong voice, whether that's something lyrical like Jacqueline Carey's [_Kushiel's Dart_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153008.Kushiel_s_Dart) or something super minimalistic and to-the-point like [Glen Cook](https://eleanorkonik.com/tag/glen-cook/)'s _Black Company_ — although one of my favorite things about the Black Company books is how different they are depending who is the Annalist at the time.
