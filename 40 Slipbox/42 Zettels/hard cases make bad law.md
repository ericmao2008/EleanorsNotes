> In the lesser-known case, an 18-year-old climbed onto a roof at a Redding, Calif., high school in 1982 to steal a $35 floodlight. The young man fell 27 feet through the skylight and was permanently disabled. His lawyers obtained a $260,000 up-front settlement with the school district’s insurer, plus $1,500 a month, for the rest of the man’s life.

> The settlement was ridiculed. But consider that the skylight had been painted over. It wasn’t visible. Nine months earlier, a 19-year-old man on his way to a swimming pool at another high school in the same school district fell through a painted-over skylight and died.
