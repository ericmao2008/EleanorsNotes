Therefore the first scientific problem that must be addressed is what the correlation with these physiological measurements has to do with deception.  It seems clear that the objective is to measure anxiety, but this presupposes that individuals become anxious for the same reasons and under the same circumstances.  Since there is no context for these measurements by themselves, the thinking is that by asking some control questions, a kind of baseline can be established against which deception can be measured.
