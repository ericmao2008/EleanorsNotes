The word "laser" is an acronym for "light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation." 

An object (originally a crystal, it was first discovered with rubies) will "lase" when it is stimulated by broad-spectrum light, the electrons will jump shell and then when they fall back down, emit a particular kind of light. 

The back-formed verb to lase is frequently used in the field, meaning "to give off coherent light," especially in reference to the gain medium of a laser; when a laser is operating it is said to be "lasing."
