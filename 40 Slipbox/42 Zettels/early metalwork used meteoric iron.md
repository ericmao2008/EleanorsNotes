	- ["] Early human metalwork often used meteoric iron, like a dagger found in the tomb of King Tutankhamen. A recent study used nondestructive two-dimensional chemical analyses and found the classic Widmanstätten pattern on the blade’s surface, which “implies the source meteorite of the dagger blade to be octahedrite”. The preservation of the pattern through forging suggests that the dagger was manufactured by low-temperature (< 950 °C) processes, while calcium impurities in the golden hilt hint at a calcium-based plaster adhesive, putting the dagger’s likely origin in Anatolia, not Egypt.
