The Minoan civilization was a [[Bronze Age]] Aegean civilization on the island of Crete and other Aegean Islands, flourishing from c. 3000 BC to c. 1450 BC until a late period of decline, finally ending around 1100 BC. It represents the first advanced civilization in Europe, leaving behind massive building complexes, tools, artwork, writing systems, and a massive network of trade.

The reasons for the slow decline of the Minoan civilization, beginning around 1550 BCE, are unclear; theories include [[Mycenaean]] [[Greek]] invasions from the mainland of Greece and the major volcanic eruption of Santorini.
