It's weirdly not-weird how the weird side effects of a really expensive procedure that are designed to make you look "naturally young" became itself a "fashionable" thing. Sort of like how white-pale faces from powder are more fashionable than genuinely pale faces, or how unnatural white wigs during the colonial era did. It's not unexpected, it's just ... definitely a common phenomenon throughout history. I should #research this to find other examples; I bet someone has done studies on this from a psychological or anthropological perspective.
