there are several mountains that serve as a tri-point dividing line between different watersheds. 

- [I] #fic/storyStem could have a mage take over one of those mountains and dune-style threaten to destroy all the watersheds if people don't pay him tribute. The story arc could be banding together to destroy him, reference and invert/subvert the sad horrible thing about the American stealing the Mexican salt area [[2021.12.27 Salt]]
