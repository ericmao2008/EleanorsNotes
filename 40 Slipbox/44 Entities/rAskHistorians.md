### What's the most unique thing you've ever come across in your field of study? 

The more I read history the more I have a sense that there's always an analogous situation in real life — status symbols, dick jokes, romantic woes, making alcohol, etc — people are people, even when they're not perfectly identical to us. But every now and then I come across something that's totally foreign to me, like 

### How does feudalism compare to hacienda systems?

The big distinction I'm familiar with is the direction of money flow. In a [[hacienda]] systems the powerful ranch owners pay employees, who are free to move from place to place, whereas with feudal systems, serfs pay taxes to the nobles and have limited mobility. Still otherwise the Spanish hacienda systems seem really similar to European models of [[feudalism]] in terms of concentration of effective power. My preliminary research wasn't really able to turn up a good look into the similarities and differences but I would really like to understand both better.

Thanks!

### [How did the ancients teach literacy?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l6vwwi/how_did_the_ancients_teach_literacy/)

> I've been doing a lot of reading about the optimum methodologies for preparing my infant son to read -- read a book a day, manipulatives, etc. -- and it got me to thinking:

>I know that many members of the upper classes in most ancient societies (I'm thinking offhand of dynastic China, Egypt, Babylon, Greece...), particularly the priesthoods, were literate, but how did they teach literacy? I've heard, anecdotally, about families in early America teaching their children literacy via nightly Bible readings, but did upper-class Egyptian women go over scrolls with their children? Were their Mesopotamian schools in Babylon that had a specific method of teaching children to read? What age did they start at? Do we know?
