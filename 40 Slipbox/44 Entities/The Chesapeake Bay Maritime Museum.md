All my pictures got deleted :sob: Here's what I managed to salvage from my visit to the [Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum](https://cbmm.org/) during my [[2021-04-10 trip to St Michaels]].

- I didn't know you could forge cannons out of bronze! 
- What did privateers do when there wasn't a war on?? 
- Basically a gun for a giant except it's real haha. Useful for [[Neith]]? 
- Boatbuilding and decoy carving uses the same skills, so craftsmen usually did both. 
- Bodkin elementary is named after an island that disappeared.
