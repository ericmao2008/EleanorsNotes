* [[the first recorded war was in Sumeria]]
* [wars were mostly fought in summer](https://www.quora.com/Which-part-of-the-year-season-started-most-wars) – not enough sources but a good starting point for what I’m trying to do. 

From a historical perspective, most wars were fought in summer. In the case of multi-year wars, battles tend to be fought in summer. 

But that’s possibly just the classical world because lots of parts of the world didn’t _have_ summer. 

- [?] when were wars / battles / raiding seasons outside of places that have clear “summer/winter” seasons fought?
