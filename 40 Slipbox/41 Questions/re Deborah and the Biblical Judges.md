> Hello folks! I minored in religious studies about ten years ago in college, but lately I've been doing more nonfiction reading. When I stumbled across the story of Andamana of the Canary Islands from Rejected Princesses it really reminded me of Deborah and the book of Judges.

> My (laymen) take on the Biblical judges is that their power was presumably based in, well, justice. From what I can tell, the etymological origin of shopheṭ is “judge” or “to pass judgment.” Everybody talks about how they were "basically" Roman magistrates and functioned as military leaders, but do we have any evidence about how they came into exists as judges? Deborah is described as holding court and rendering judgment, so I'm wondering if we know much about whether she gained influence due to her keen legal insight or if it was because of something else?
