I'm a woman in the Bronze Age with no special access to prestige items. Do I own a knife? What kind? What do I use it for?
The impression I've gotten is that copper and bronze knives were prestige items, not necessarily something that every household would have used for cutting meat or fibers, but what about stone knives? Obsidian blades? How common a tool was a knife for the average person? Do we know?

I've read about the mass production of bone tools, and I imagine that stone knives were relatively common, but were they necessary for every individual, or were they the sort of thing a community leader might have and allow to be used as needed, like how bread ovens were basically one-per-community?

I'm trying to get a sense of when metal knives became a common household / personal item and what would have been normal before that time.

Also, I realize that "the Bronze Age" is pretty broad, but I'm interested in broad trends and would be happy with an answer about any region, urban or rural, settled or nomadic.
