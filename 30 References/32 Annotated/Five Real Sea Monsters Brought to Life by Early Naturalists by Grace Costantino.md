### q1 octopuses might explain hydra myths

> Many scholars have postulated that the hydra is based on octopuses. After all, their many tentacles could be misinterpreted as heads, and octopuses can regenerate lost limbs, possibly explaining the unending head supply of the hydra.

### q2 octopuses are very smart

> octopuses are perhaps the most intelligent invertebrates, demonstrating complex problem-solving abilities and the use of tools. In the case of the octopus, it is more a story of the monster that simply misunderstood.

### q3 sharks might explain sea serpent myths

> [Basking sharks](http://eol.org/pages/225080/overview), measuring up to 40 feet in length, have also been mistaken for sea serpents. In 1808, a badly decomposed carcass washed up on Stronsay. At a meeting of the Wernerian Natural History Society in Edinburgh, it was asserted that this carcass was the same creature described in accounts of sea serpents, and it was given the name *Halsydrus* (“sea water snake”). Later analysis of the skin and cartilage revealed that the “monster” was in fact a basking shark, and hardly a monster. These gentle giants are passive feeders with a diet of zooplankton and small fish and invertebrates.

### q4 deformed snakes might explain sea serpent myths

> [One of the most infamous sea serpent episodes](http://www.kew.org/discover/blogs/monster-massachusetts) spanned decades. From 1817 to 1819, a mass of people, including fishermen, military personnel and pedestrians, reported seeing a sea monster at least 80 but perhaps 100 feet long, with a head resembling a horse, in the harbor off Gloucester, Massachusetts. There were so many eyewitness reports that the Linnaean Society of New England formed a special investigating committee to examine the possibility of such a creature. In October 1817, two young boys found a 3-foot-long serpent body with humps on a beach not far from where the sightings had occurred. The Linnaean Society declared that the Gloucester sea serpent had visited the harbor to lay eggs, and that the specimen the boys had found represented one of its young. They invented an entirely new genus and named it *Scoliophis atlanticus* (“Atlantic Humped Snake”). Shortly thereafter, naturalist Alexandre Lesueur examined the specimen and reported that it was, in fact, a deformed common blacksnake ([*Coluber constrictor*](http://eol.org/pages/1286340/overview)).

### q5 folktale about giant whale as island

> In the 6th century A.D., Irish cleric St. Brendan and 18 other monks sailed out from Ireland to cross the ocean. During their journey, they came upon a black, treeless island and decided to make camp for the night. Several monks set up a cooking station and lit a fire. And then the island began to move. Terrified, the monks fled back to their boat, leaving the food and fire behind. St. Brandon urged them not to be afraid; it was simply the great fish Jasconius, “which laboreth night and day to put his tail in his mouth, but for greatness he may not.”
> In *Historia Animalium*, [Conrad Gessner describes](http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/23574972) Jasconius by another name: the Trol whale, or Devil whale, which lies asleep in the water and is often mistaken for an island by hapless sailors. Gessner was likely inspired by [Olaus Magnus, who claimed](http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/23574974) that the whale's skin is like sand, lending to its confusion with a beach. When the sailors’ dinner fires disturb the whale, it sinks, causing such a whirlpool that the ships themselves are often sunk.

### q6

> Baleen whales like the humpback do have two blowholes.

### q65 here be dragons originates from 1510 maps

> *HIC SUNT DRACONES.”*
> This phrase translates from the Latin as “here are dragons.” It is etched on the eastern coast of Asia on one of the oldest terrestrial globe maps, the [Lenox Globe](http://exhibitions.nypl.org/treasures/items/show/163), dating to 1510. Though the phrase itself is found on only one other historical artifact—a [1504 globe crafted on an ostrich egg](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/oldest-globe-to-depict-the-new-world-may-have-been-discovered/2013/08/19/503b2b4a-06b4-11e3-a07f-49ddc7417125_story.html)—depictions of monsters and mythological beasts are common on early maps.

Might be a fun thing for Verraine, to have an old map discovered and fight over, a la pern where they didn't trust the old records, but it's almost like a treasure hunt. A macguffin story. The most central part of the story should be the five-man band aspect and the relationship between the characters the emotional Arc could be something along the lines of learning who you are or coming to trust people.

### q7 exaggeration and distortion fuel myth more than lies

> Where did the accounts of monsters come from in the first place? Were they simply fairy tales invented to scare curious minds and small children? Henry Lee, who wrote extensively on sea creatures and monsters, emphasized that many classical monsters are not simply pure myth. In his publication [*Sea Fables Explained*](http://biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/10456#/summary) (1883), he wrote, “… the descriptions by ancient writers of so-called ‘fabulous creatures’ are rather distorted portraits than invented falsehoods, and there is hardly any of the monsters of old which has not its prototype in Nature at the present day.”

### q8

> More often than not, their information came not from first-hand observations but from sailors’ accounts of mysterious encounters while at sea. Less often, the decomposing remains of a washed-up carcass fueled confidence in the existence of these terrible beasts.

### q9

> Sailors, or beachgoers who had the misfortune to stumble upon a rotting basking shark, had no experience with such creatures. So they explained them with what they knew well: myths and legends. If they enlivened their accounts, that simply made for a better story. And so an oarfish became a 200-foot-long sea serpent. A giant squid became a blood-thirsty kraken. A manatee became a mermaid. Magnus and others like him gobbled up the stories and published them alongside authentic species. The more the stories were circulated and published, the more likely people were to mistake what they did see for a monster. And the cycle continued.

### q10 squid are the largest invertebrates 

> The giant squid currently holds the record as the second-largest mollusk and extant invertebrate, exceeded only by the colossal squid. Recent studies have revealed that it feeds on deep-sea fish and other squids, but its hunting methods and reproductive cycle are still unknown. While it was long believed that there were many species within the *Architeuthis* genus, [recent genetic analysis](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23296-worlds-giant-squid-are-one-big-happy-family.html) suggests there is only one: [*Architeuthis dux*](http://eol.org/pages/488790/overview). Claims of lengths reaching 150 to 200 feet have been reported, even by scientists, without evidence to justify such claims. [The Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History suggests maximum lengths of nearly 60 feet.](http://invertebrates.si.edu/giant_squid/index.html)

### q11 oarfish might explain sea serpent myths

> Descriptions of sea serpents with manes or growths of hair about their necks are common amongst monster lore. This feature provides a clue to one of the animals often mistaken for a sea serpent: the oarfish. An enigmatic creature, [the oarfish](http://eol.org/pages/225594/overview) is the longest bony fish alive, possibly measuring as long as 45 to 50 feet. Human encounters with these fish are rare, but we know they do have a red cockscomb of spines on their head and a red dorsal fin running the length of their bodies. Fleeting glimpses of oarfish could easily be exaggerated into an encounter with a monstrous sea serpent, and, to an untrained eye, the remains of such a fish washed up on a beach could understandably resemble the sea serpent of legend.
