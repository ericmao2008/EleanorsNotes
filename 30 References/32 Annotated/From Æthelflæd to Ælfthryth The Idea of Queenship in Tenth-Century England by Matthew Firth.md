## Highlights

###  q1 histories categorize types of queenship

> Historians have, nonetheless, adopted certain sub-categories of queenship based around a royal woman’s means of accessing authority that have broad application. As [summarized by Theresa Earenfight](https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Queenship_in_Medieval_Europe/GD4dBQAAQBAJ?hl=en), these are queen-regnant, queen-regent, queen-consort, queen-mother or dowager-queen (p. 6). Only one of these constitutes authority in its own right, the queen regnant. Queens-regnant, however, are not a feature of the political landscape of tenth-century England. Queenly agency was rather defined and delimited by each woman’s relationship with the king, the starting point of which was usually as queen-consort.

###  q2 English queens were rare in the 10th century

> the exemplar of the early tenth-century queen-consort Eadburh who was purported to have abused her queenly authority and ultimately to have poisoned her husband the king. Whatever truth may lie behind Asser’s tale, his observations of West Saxon attitudes to queenship seem to have a certain veracity. After Judith’s consecration, which in itself was informed by her status as a scion of the West Frankish royal family, no English queen is known to have again been anointed as such until over a century later in 973.

> the political milieu of the tenth century would bring several powerful women to the fore, whose authority would seemingly bely any exhortation against the dangers of female power. Yet it also remains that despite any personal agency, such women are only rarely named as queen.

###  q4 many kings took concubines instead of marrying

> At a fundamental level, what would now be identified as queenship was, in tenth-century England, predicated on marriage to the king. As a result, the distinction between a king’s wife and a king’s concubine was politically charged.

### q5 political considerations impact elite marriage choices

> A lack of formal marriage allowed the setting aside of one concubine in favor of a more politically attractive union relatively simpler. If there was no evidence of marriage, no public declaration of intent, no exchange of lands, then how simple for a king to set aside consort as a bed companion alone with no marital legitimacy. This was, no doubt, the approach taken by both Edward and Edgar to their unions with their first wives; it is no coincidence that it was most often a king’s first consort, a match made before he ascended the throne, who was identified as a concubine.

### q6 Ælfthryth's coronation normalized queenship in England

> Ælfthryth’s queenship was legitimated as no queen-consort’s had been since Judith’s coronation. She was a [regular witness](https://esawyer.lib.cam.ac.uk/charter/766.html) to Edgar’s charters, attesting as [*regina*](https://esawyer.lib.cam.ac.uk/charter/767.html)[queen] [around twenty times](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/haskins-society-journal-30/beyond-corfe-aelfthryths-roles-as-queen-villain-and-former-sisterinlaw/51F58CAD31349DFD494248820CF2C2DD), the first West Saxon consort to do so. She was a known intermediary with the king, at times receiving gifts for performing in that role. She was a landholder – the queen’s dower having increasingly become a traditional prerogative through the tenth century. She was codified in [*Regularis concordia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularis_Concordia_(Winchester)) as patron and protector of the kingdom’s female religious houses. Finally, she was formally crowned queen in 973 alongside her husband during the pageantry of his second coronation in Bath. Ælfthryth’s tenure as queen was remarkable for the shift toward institutional office that codification of duties and consecration implied – the latter an exemplar for her successors with coronation becoming the norm in the eleventh century.
