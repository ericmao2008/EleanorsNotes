- [ ] Does this scene escalate the problem? Are the stakes (especially on an emotional level) clear?
- [ ] Does the protagonist react internally to everything in the moment as they struggle to make sense of it and bend it to their advantage? Must always draw a strategic conclusion that impacts what they’re doing or how they’re interpreting what’s happening, for example “is this safe? What should I do? What did he mean? How will this impact me?” 
- [ ] Is the struggle between the secret desire / need and the cost of attaining it explicit? 
- [ ] Is there some sort of twist to shock reader into continuing?
- [ ] Is there enough description to set the scene? Are at least 3 senses used? Is every character anchored with a quick, recurring tag? 
- [ ] Are the characters discussing a plan, or doing something? Don't plan. Do!
- [ ] Is everything as specific as possible?
