## Highlights

### id253299529 infrasound helps seabirds navigate

> Now a new study led by researchers at the University of Liverpool has explored the idea that infrasound—low frequency sound below 20 Hz—could play an important role in helping seabirds find their way across [open water](https://phys.org/tags/open+water/).
> There have been a handful of studies suggesting infrasound could be a valuable navigation cue and this study reviews how and why it birds might use it."
> "We suggest that infrasound may be an important cue for [seabird](https://phys.org/tags/seabird/) navigation, particularly over long-distances when other cues are uninformative. Further research is needed that brings together models, seabird movement data and in-situ [infrasound](https://phys.org/tags/infrasound/) measurements in order to garner more insight into this important question.
