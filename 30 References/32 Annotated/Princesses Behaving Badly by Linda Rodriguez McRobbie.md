> I started reading "Princesses Behaving Badly" that SIL got me for Christmas like a year ago, and it's actually really good. I particularly enjoyed the Army of the Lady and how the first Tang Emperor's daughter played such an enormous role in overthrow the previous (terrible) ruler of [[China]] -- it would make amazing fodder for a novel and probably has already been done.
