> The Jomon Period (c. 14,500 - c. 300 BCE) of ancient Japan produced a distinctive pottery which distinguishes it from the earlier Paleolithic Age. Jomon pottery vessels are the oldest in the world and their impressed decoration, which resembles rope, is the origin of the word jomon, meaning 'cord pattern'.

> Potters were likely semi-specialists only dedicating some of their time to pottery manufacture. 

Interesting contrast with the early [[specialization of textile creation]]. 

> As kilns have not been excavated from the period it is thought that vessels were fired in open fires.

I’m not sure I realized any pottery was done in open fires as opposed to kilns. I’m used to ovens being pretty normal, especially for baking bread. 

> When migrants from the Asian continent began to arrive in Japan from around 400 BCE (or even earlier), they brought with them new pottery techniques, forms, and decoration. It is interesting to note that this expansion of ideas from abroad is evidenced in western Japan then displaying a much greater variation in pottery manufacture than the eastern side of the islands. The fashion for minimal decoration became widespread in western Japan, as did a distinction between glazed and unglazed wares.  

This is a great example of the diffusion of culture. Also, I love minimalist fashions and this is a great example of it. 

> Jomon pottery was, consequently, gradually replaced by the finer pottery of the Yayoi Period (c. 300 BCE - c. 250 CE) which has no decoration and a reddish colour. These wares would be replaced in turn by the higher quality Sue stoneware which was introduced from Korea in the Kofun Period (c. 250 CE - 538 CE).
