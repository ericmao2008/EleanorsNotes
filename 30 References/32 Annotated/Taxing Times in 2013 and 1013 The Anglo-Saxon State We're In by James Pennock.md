## Highlights

### id242084408 a leader can be too effective at collecting taxes

> Unlike David Cameron, who faces popular criticism for his administration’s failure to gather taxes effectively, a thousand years ago the king had the opposite problem: he was far too effective at collecting taxes

### id242084439 the medieval English taxation system was unusually efficient

> Whilst Anglo-Saxon kings had made such payments before, they had always been one-offs. Unfortunately for Aethelred, the Danes developed a sweet tooth for such treats, and came back to get their fill on at least four more occasions during his reign, each time taking a larger bite. In 1012 they gorged themselves on a rich buffet of 48,000 pounds of silver. This tribute was financed by an annual land tax which later became known as [Danegeld](http://www.ctl.law.cam.ac.uk/tax_history_conference/papers_2012/tax_history_2012%20babara%20abraham%20Danegeld%20Paper%20Draft%2009-07-12.pdf). At a time when public taxation systems were rare, this new English system was both efficient and effective, forming the basis of English taxation for around 170 years. The tax was unpopular,[[3]](http://www.historymatters.group.shef.ac.uk/tax-2013-1013-anglo-saxon-state/) but it filled the royal coffers, and at a time of political instability it made the Danes salivate all the more

### id242084442 medieval England had merit-based advancement opportunities

> So how did Aethelred manage to collect such sizeable taxes so quickly? He led an effective organisation with a motivated management team. The Anglo-Saxon state was a remarkable feat of administrative engineering, in which personal prosperity became intrinsically linked to royal service. From the ashes of the ninth-century Viking invasions rose the phoenix of the ealdorman. Appointed by the king, the ealdormen raised his armies, delivered his justice and collected his taxes in their respective regions, known as shires. These important roles increasingly ceased to be hereditary, and offered an enticing opportunity for advancement. So Aethelred was not short of men waiting to efficiently execute his commands, however misguided they may be. His nobles even tried to follow the king’s order to slay all Danish men in England on [St Brice’s Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Brice's_Day_massacre) 1002AD.
