## Highlights

> Historical Materialism sees history is as having distinct time periods that are determined by the material and technological conditions of the times. This is often broken into specific stages: primitive communism (during the hunter-gatherer period, aka most of humanity’s existence); the ancient mode of production (early agriculture, slaves, all that); the feudal mode of production (nobles, serfs, what have you); and finally/currently the capitalist mode of production (now). So you, know, not a lot of medieval history about the shop.
> 
> Interestingly, as anti-Marxist as our society often is, this idea has been pretty much absorbed by culture writ large. We believe in it so hard that I have to constantly get in arguments with non-experts about feudalism, because it didn’t really exist. However, because our society has internalized the idea of a mythic feudalism to capitalism pipeline, it often treats our own society both as inevitable and a step in the right direction. Even those who are critical of capitalism will think stuff like, “Well yeah it is not good but at least I am not a serf, so this is progress.”

### id263736667 medieval communal republics existed

> there were places and times in medieval Europe where people actually organised communal republics and today I want to tell you about two of them: the independent peasants’ republic of Dithmarschen and the communal Hussite society of Tabor.

### id263736810 marshlands are hard to externally rule 

> [Dithmarschen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dithmarschen) is still an area on the North Sea, in what is now Germany, and was one of those parts of Northern Europe that people hadn’t got around to draining out yet, unlike the lowlands in what is now Belgium and the Netherlands. So it was, as the name indicates, a big ol’ marsh that supported smaller communities to thrive. One of the big reasons they did so was the wool trade. Marshy land wasn’t great for planting crops, but was excellent for grazing hardly lil’ sheep on, and so people did that, collected wool, and made cloth. However, the generalised marshy conditions of the place overall made it super hard to rule with an iron fist or whatever, cuz what were you gonna do? March an army through here to oppress the shepherds? Good luck man, this is a bog.

### id263736845 Dithmarschen was a peasant's republic 

> Nominally, they were still controlled by the Archbishop of Bremen, but in practice, they were what we now recognise as a peasants’ republic. They set up a series of communes, based around their local parishes, which chose their own representatives. As a collective, the *terrae universitatis Dithmarsiae*, or united lands of Dithmarschen passed their own laws, which was overseen by a common assembly. They also, crucially, administered their own resources, meaning that there were no overlords taking a cut along the way.

### id263736852 peasant republics were able to rule well and defend themselves

> it worked super super well. Turns out a bunch of peasants were perfectly able to get their heads around the ins and outs of legislation and law making, as well as taxation and how to govern. It was always perfectly workable – the technological conceits of the time be damned.
> 
> Of course, not everyone was happy about peasants having a nice time, and neighbouring nobles attempted at various times to reign in that whole poor people doing self-determination thing. However, not only could the poors organise governance, they could also do self-defense. They fought off attacks from, among others, the King of Denmark, the rulers of Schleswig, and the nearby Counts of Holstein-Rendsburg. Repeatedly. Over and over. Just a lot. At times they also allied with their neighbouring free peasants in neighbouring Wursten.

### id263737119 Dithmarschen lasted 300 years 

> Eventually in 1559 the belligerent rich guys won out, with the Danish Count [Johan Rantzau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Rantzau) (1492-1565) eventually going in real hard to oppress the locals and just generally be a dick about things. However, a three-hundred-year run is longer than, say, America has been going at things, so you can’t say that a peasant-run communal elective system wasn’t possible or successful.

### id263739064 difficult to fight a monarchy without your soldiers becoming rulers 

> The history of communities like Dithmarschen and Tabor is important because it calls into question what we consider to be the inevitability of unequal systems as well as capitalism. Even in a time with fewer freedoms and more fractured forms of communication, people were able and eager to establish communities and societies that worked for them. They were expressly working against authority and pushing for a society where they lived and were treated equally. It was never inevitable that the medieval period end with capitalism, and capitalism wasn’t necessary in order to bring about an end to “feudalism”, whatever the hell that is supposed to be. It was always possible for communities to govern themselves, and it was only concerted violent coercion from the ruling forces that prevented that from happening.
> 
> There is a lesson here for us all. It has always been viable for our societies to be more equal and communal. We can look to the past and communities like Dithmarschen and Tabor for clues about how to organise a better and more equitable future. None of this was inevitable, and none of it is permanent. We are simply prevented from achieving this through the interests of the wealthy.
