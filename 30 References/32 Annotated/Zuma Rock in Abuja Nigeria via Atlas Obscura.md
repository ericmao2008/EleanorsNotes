### id263280212 the Zuba people settled around and sacrificed to a large rock

> The rock was found in the 15th century by the Zuba people of Niger State, who called it *zumwa*, which could translate to “a place of guinea fowls,” due to their abundance around the rock. The Zuba people settled around the rock and came to see it as a spiritual guide, making sacrifices to the rock to keep them safe from harm. Because the landmark offered a clear view of the surrounding landscape, it was also used as a defensive position from other invading tribes.
