> Some of the most fascinating scientific questions relate to aliens. (By "aliens" I mean any lifeform dropped into a totally new environment, not grays with anal probes.) You'd think the alien would die in the strange environment - often this is true! But sometimes aliens have a competitive advantage.
> 
> Rabbits in England are preyed upon by a host of animals, which holds their fitness in check. But when they were brought to Australia, a place with few or no natural predators, they took over. Their alienness gave them an advantage. The country now has a hundred and fifty million feral rabbits - about eight times more rabbits than people.
> 
> Agricultural crops often do best far away from their native land, where pests and pathogens are adapted to them. New-world maize and cocoa are among the biggest crops in Africa. Conversely, most coffee is grown in South America. Sometimes being far from home is a good thing.
> The diseases spread by the Columbian expansion were famously very bad for the Native Americans, and that's definitely the alien advantage in action. So why won't permafrost viruses do the same to us?
> 
> Probably because "alien advantage" falls off quickly. You can't be too ill-suited for your environment or your fitness goes away. So there's a weird curve in play: "close" diseases (that we come into contact with regularly) normally aren't that bad: our bodies have built up defenses to them. "Far" diseases (such as the smallpox that wiped out the Taino) are worse. But VERY far diseases hit a species barrier and become harmless, unless they can cross over.
