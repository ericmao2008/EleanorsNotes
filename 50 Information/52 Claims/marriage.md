- [[Brotherhood of Kings by Amanda Podany]] does a lot with how the civilizations in the Fertile Crescent treated princesses as a diplomatic corps, as opposed to Egyptians, who found the idea of "marrying off" their daughters appalling (but were happy to accept the daughters of nearby kings as "tribute")  ^7dbace
- There is a story in [[The Amazons by Adrienne Mayor]] about how marriages between Scythian women and non-Scythian men helped form new tribes. 
- [[The Horse The Wheel And Language by David Anthony#ch08p153 Wives|The Horse, the Wheel, and Language by David Anthony]] addresses the behaviors of wives who marry into foreign tribes. 
- [[The Civilizations of Africa by Christopher Ehret]] addresses the impact of different frameworks of marriage on various African civilizations, e.g. particularly:
