- I used to be confused about why artistic, painted pottery was so often by archaeologists to learn about ancient peoples, until I realized 
	* (1) it's less likely to degrade than a lot of other materials 
	* (2) it's used for *food storage and transportation* so it's hella common, it's not just "art" 
	* (3) painted amphorae are functionally the equivalent of tractor trailer trucks with advertisements and art decorating them, or the logos painted on wine bottles.
