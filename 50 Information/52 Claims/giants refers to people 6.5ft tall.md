I came across [[A Look at Kumsay The Graveyard of Giants by Museum Scythia]] and the blogger is very excited because some graves associated with the Yamnaya people (but who might not be, quite) are filled with people who are very tall, which, okay. But I'm not sure why 6" is being treated as "SUCH GIANTS!" When I hear "giants" I tend to think closer to 7ft at the absolute smallest, and more likely, stuff like Jack in the Beanstalk or something like the cyclops from that terrible Iliad/Odyssey movie I watched in high school. 

There an #nonfic/articleSeed/afterword here about how stories about "giants" metastasize in the telling, related to my article about exaggeration, and probably the [[Five Real Sea Monsters Brought to Life by Early Naturalists by Grace Costantino]]
