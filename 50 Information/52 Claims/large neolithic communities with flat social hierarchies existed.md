Çatalhöyük (Turkey) predates urbanization, states money and private property. It began to exist around the same time as [[domestication]]. It had tight-packed mudbrick houses for up to 8k people, lasted 1k years, left no signs of social hierarchy (or government) or war, had a mixed economy, and changed in its relationship with animals over time, as determined by a variety of factors. The houses were so close together that they entered their homes via rooftop ladders. 

They had a mixed economy, farming and herding hunting and gathering. They created a bunch of animal-shaped statuettes and figurines.
