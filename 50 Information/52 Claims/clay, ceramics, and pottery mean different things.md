Clay is the raw material (decomposed igneous rock) that gets extracted from the earth. It becomes ceramic once it's heated (fired). 
 
To be precise, “pottery” refers to all functional vessels: cups, plates, bowls, wine jars, teapots, vases, jugs, etc. “Ceramics”, collectively includes pottery, but also means anything made of clay, including non-functional and decorative items, such as masks, signs, wall hangings, dolls, sculpture, beads, bricks, and tiles.
 
Clay is usually not very pure. Most clay deposits have other elements mixed in, which gives the clay different properties. Raw clay can have a range of colors, including white, pale gray, light tan, rusty red, brown or even black. The darker the clay, the more likely that other elements such as iron, are in the mix.
