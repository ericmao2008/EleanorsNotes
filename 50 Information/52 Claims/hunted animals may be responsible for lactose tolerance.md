Neolithic humans eating chyme (from the bellies of predators that ate lactating females) or lactating females themselves may have been related to the early invention of cheese and may even be related to the origins of lactose tolerance in humans. Chyme is basically gastric juices and partially digested food from the entrails of animals.
