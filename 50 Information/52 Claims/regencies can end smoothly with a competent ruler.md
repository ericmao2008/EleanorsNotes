- [?] I was re-reading L. E. Modesitt's Spellsong Cycle, which spoiler alert involves a regency and a relatively spoiled heir whose reign goes pretty poorly despite the best attempts of the regents, and it got me to thinking about how hard it must be to raise a future king under the best of circumstances, much less with a regency. Do y'all know of any instances where a regency ended smoothly, with a competent leader taking over without any sort of major crises during the handoff? Medieval history isn't my baliwick normally so I'm woefully underinformed about possibilities.
