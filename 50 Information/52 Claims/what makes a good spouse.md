When I was young, I unconsciously bought in to the idea of love conquering all. I thought it was unfair to count a man's job against him — money shouldn't matter if I really loved a guy, right? What really mattered was his character. 

A strong work ethic could overcome anything, right? 

As long as a guy liked me and I didn't have _incontrovertible_ proof he'd cheated on me, I felt like any kind of rejection was unfair—immoral even.
