The foundational river in [[China]] is called the Yellow River because its waters carry silt, which give the river its yellow-brown color, and when the river overflows, it leaves a yellow residue behind. While the river helps create fertile land that is suited for farming, during certain times of the year the Huang He frequently overflows. The water damages housing and crops across the North China Plain, an important agricultural region. 

Because of this, the Huang He is also nicknamed “China’s Sorrow.” 

This led to the development of some very impressive [[Chinese infrastructure]].
