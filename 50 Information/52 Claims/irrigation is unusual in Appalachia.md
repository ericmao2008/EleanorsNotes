> Irrigation is actually unusual in much of Appalachia and the Southeastern US, partly because it does rain regularly, and partly because the common clay soils tend to get as hard as a rock if soaked and allowed to dry. They need to be kept damp, or just lightly watered, which the usual rain and humidity do better than heavy irrigation.
