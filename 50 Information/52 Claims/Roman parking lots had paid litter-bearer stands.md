Lots of fantastic information about stuff like paid litter-bearer stands (like cab stands) in places where wheeled conveyances were illegal (i.e., the [[Roman]] cities). Neat stuff about how often games in the Colosseum took place, who paid for it, why, and when. Also, apparently Rome had public slaves? I had no idea and am now fascinated by how that might work.
