>  not only did the crab-like habitus evolve independently from the ‘true’ crabs (Brachyura), it also evolved three times independently within anomurans. This process has been called ‘carcinization’ by the English zoologist Lancelot Alexander Borradaile in 1916. In this paper we summarize the results of our recent studies into the evolution of the crab-like morphotype (i.e. carcinization) and into possible structural dependences (i.e. coherences) between the external morphology of a crab-like habitus and inner organs. 

> One important aspect seems to have been the need to protect the pleon against predators by folding it under the ventral side of the body

> The evolutionary transformation from hermit crabs into king crabs is probably the most familiar and impressive example of carcinization.
