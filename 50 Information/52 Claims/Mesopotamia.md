Mesopotamia is a historical region of Western Asia situated within the Tigris–Euphrates river system, in the northern part of the [[Fertile Crescent|Fertile Crescent]]. It corresponds with much of Iraq, Kuwait, Syria and Turkey. 

[[Sumer]] (3000–2000 B.C.E. ) dominated Mesopotamia at the beginning of written history (c. 3100 BCE), followed by the Akkadians (2350–2218 B.C.E. ), [[Babylon]] (1894–1595 B.C.E. ) (Conquered by [[Egypt]]), [[Assyria]] (1380–612 B.C.E. ), and the [[Persia]] Empire (Achaemenid Empire) (550–330 B.C.E. ). Then it was conquered by Alexander the Great and fell to Islamic Conquest.
