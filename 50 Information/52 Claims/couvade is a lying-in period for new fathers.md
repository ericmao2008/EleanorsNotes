The article showcases an interesting phenomenon where in some societies, the _father_ of a newborn has a "lieing-in" period while the mother who _just gave birth_ gets right back to work. I honestly kind of like it, since the idea seems to be that the man stays home and doesn't do normal hunting and fishing activities or eat meat or whatever.
