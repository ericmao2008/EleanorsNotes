- [I] Evidence for [[climate change requires reaction regardless of cause]] — it doesn't matter whether Mongols _caused_ global cooling or were _driven_ by it, the point is that the wars and epidemics were something for people to be aware of, and the climate change of 800-1850 probably had discernable impacts.
