# Harappan Civilization 

The Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harrapan Civilization, was a [[Bronze Age]] civilization more widespread than its contemporaries in either [[China]], [[Mesopotamia]] or ancient [[Egypt]].

The civilisation's cities were noted for their urban planning, baked brick houses, elaborate [[2020.09.14 Sewers|drainage]] systems, water supply systems, clusters of large non-residential buildings, and new techniques in handicraft (carnelian products, seal carving) and metallurgy (copper, bronze, lead, and tin). Its largest cities probably had between 30,000 and 60,000 inhabitants, which led to an increased death and disease rate due to the intermingling of people and [[domestication|domesticated]] animals.

## Agriculture 
The Harrapan are the earliest people to use complex multi-cropping strategies across both seasons, growing foods during summer (rice, millets and beans) and winter (wheat, barley and pulses), which required different watering regimes.[^agriculture]
