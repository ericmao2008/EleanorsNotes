- With [this historian's roundup of imagery relating to witches—and the role of women in making alcohol](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/m6d2wf/was_there_a_time_or_place_when_brewing_ale_was/gra9amq/), particularly enjoyed the insight that the displacement of women from beer-brewing was mostly due to the *industrialization* of beer-brewing—which was helped by access to hops, which acted as a preservative (didn't I read something else about hops recently?). (Gives me an [[Article & Blog Idea]] to discuss the role of beer brewing in fiction — Redemption of Althus by David Eddings comes to mind. Also, about how industrialization is usually presented as a positive by books, but what about all of the negatives, for example for women?)
