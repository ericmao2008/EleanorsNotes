[[Josephine Quinn]] asked "what's the difference a Thing and a Folkmoot?" ie when the Vikings turned up in England with their Thing, did it basically already exist there? And if so, how come, as I've read, the English vocab of 'law' and politics (hustings) is derived more from Old Norse?

The answer she got was: 

> Both are variations on the same theme. The Moden English law does indeed come from ON, but there were OE equivalents. (It's popularity is probably owed in part to being the favoured term of Wulfstan II of York, a leading law-maker in the early 11th C.)
