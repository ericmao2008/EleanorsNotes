one of my secret dreams is to figure out pivot tables in excel. They have no usefulness for my job or personal life but the bloggers I read are forever talking about them and they sound so powerful

> why "secret" dream?

it's just one of those things I don't talk about much because I don't want someone to be like "oh they're easy just do blahblahblah" and then have to be like "I know how to learn it, I just haven't prioritized it" because I feel like there's a stigma (maybe only in my own head, maybe a neuroses due to ex-boyfriends) of saying you want something but not taking steps to make it happen.

I said to my husband once something along the lines of "I don't want to learn linux, I just often find myself wanting to have been the kind of person who learned linux." But I don't usually talk about it, because I don't want to waste people's helpfulness-energy on a problem I don't intend to solve, ergo "secret dream"
