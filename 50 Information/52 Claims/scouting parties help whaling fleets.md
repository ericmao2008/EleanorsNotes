- [n] I like the idea of fictionalizing this sort of thing because this meeting of the captains feels like a great chapter base, but what would the point of the story be? What would the character's point of entry be? There's definitely a short story idea here (not flash, maybe a novella, probably not a whole novel), but what's the underlying punchline? About the importance of listening to one's wife? About the value of not reaching too high? About abandoning capitalism and the pursuit of money? I like that. They could wind up deciding to stop trying to exploit nature and choose to pursue happiness instead of wealth and glory.
