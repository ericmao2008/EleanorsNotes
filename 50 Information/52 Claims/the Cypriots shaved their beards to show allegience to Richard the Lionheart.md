Related to [[people have been using their clothes to signal social allegiance for thousands of years]], people will _change their appearance_ to show social allegiance. In this case, shaving a beard.  

> "All the citizens of Nicosia came out to welcome the king and admitted him as their lord. The king received them in peace and had their beards shaved off as a symbol of their change of lordship."

> So the answer is simply that the Nicosians either shaved or were forced to shave as a symbol of allegiance to their new Latin overlords. Eastern Christians and Muslims were well known for their long beards, and the Latin crusaders were known for their short beards or for being clean-shaven.
