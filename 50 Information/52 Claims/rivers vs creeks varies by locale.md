	- #fic/storyStem  this would make a good analysis piece for a story involving miscommunication or travel by boat.  I like the idea of tying it into the story about [[The Dead King's Daughter]] because that's a good example of a person who is going from one region to another where she shares a common language with someone but not necessarily common meaning. 

When I was in San Antonio, my husband and I visited a series of missions. Missions are definition. The part of the experience that surprised you most though was sitting at a restaurant in San Antonio overlooking the San Antonio River and realizing just how small the San Antonio River really is. 

By the standards of my hometown the San Antonio River is a creek. I've spent my whole life living within a mile of the Chesapeake Bay which is an estuary size. 

I can throw a baseball across the San Antonio River at its widest point  in the city without much effort.

I'm told by people from the American southwest that the definition of river is that it is a navigable body of water year-round. But the portions of the San Antonio River I saw visiting the missions or navigable only by something like canoe or kayak, and not a particularly well laden won at that. 

It was an interesting perspective on how different parts of the same country that speak the same language mean such different things when we use the same words.
