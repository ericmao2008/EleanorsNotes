The Scythians (pronounced 'SIH-thee-uns') were a group of ancient tribes of nomadic warriors who originally lived in what is now southern Siberia. Their culture flourished from around 900 BCE to around 200 BCE, by which time they had extended their influence all over Central Asia – from [[China]] to the northern Black Sea.

According to [[The Amazons by Adrienne Mayor|The Amazons by Adrienne Mayor]], they definitely had contacts with [[Greek]] civilization. 

The Scythians (also known as Scyth, Saka, Sakae, Iskuzai, or Askuzai), were a nomadic people who dominated the Pontic steppe from about the 7th century BCE up until the 3rd century BCE. They were part of the wider Scythian cultures, stretching across the Eurasian Steppe, which included many peoples that are distinguished from the Scythians. A broad concept referring to all early Eurasian nomads as "Scythians" has sometimes been used. Within this concept, the actual Scythians are referred to as Pontic Scythians. 

Use of the term "Scythians" for all early Eurasian nomads has, however, led to much confusion in literature, and the validity of such terminology is controversial. Other names for that concept are therefore preferable.

Wikipedia claims that Scythians are generally believed to have been of [[Persia]] origin (note: Really? I thought they originated in Siberia). They spoke a language of the Scythian branch of the Iranian languages, and practiced a variant of ancient Iranian religion.

Among the earliest peoples to master mounted warfare, the Scythians replaced the [[Cimmerians]] as the dominant power on the Pontic Steppe in the 8th century BCE. During this time they and related peoples came to dominate the entire Eurasian Steppe from the Carpathian Mountains in the west to Ordos Plateau in the east, creating what has been called the first Central Asian nomadic empire.
