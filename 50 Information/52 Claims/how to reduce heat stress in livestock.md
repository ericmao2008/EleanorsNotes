- [v] [Adaptation to hot climate and strategies to alleviate heat stress in livestock production](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aad9b29a831dd8599e34b4f9aedb66691f08c92c)
	-  strategies can be classified into three groups: 
		- increasing feed intake or decreasing metabolic heat production, 
		- enhancing heat-loss capacities
		- genetic selection for heat tolerance.
			- Although differences in thermal tolerance exist between livestock species (ruminants > monogastrics), there are also large differences between breeds of a species and within each breed. 
	- Under heat stress, improved production should be possible through modifications of diet composition that either:
		- promotes a higher intake 
		- compensates the low feed consumption. 
	- Altering feeding management such as a change in feeding time and/or frequency are efficient tools to avoid excessive heat load and improve survival rate, especially in poultry.
