Locusts are grasshoppers that have undergone a physical change due to [[phenotypic plasticity]], which in locusts is triggered by high population density. Although locusts can be highly damaging to crops and pasture, they are often considered a delicacy in regions where they are common, probably because they're rare. They impact agriculturalists more than foragers because they feed on leaves, grains, and grasses more so than mature fruit, underground tubers, nuts etc.
