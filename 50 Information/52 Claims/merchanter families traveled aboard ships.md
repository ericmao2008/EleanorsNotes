- [I] [[Backwards Mapping Fiction]] I didn't realize this sort of "merchant family aboard the ship full time" from scifi was real, but it is, see: [[On Age of Sail captains and taking their families on sea voyages#Merchant captains brought their families with them]]. They had several cabins and lived a relatively normal live, albeit even more cramped than a city apartment, but in some ways the kids lived like lords back home.
