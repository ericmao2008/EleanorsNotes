> I believe genetics suggests that while the farmer migrations of 6500 BCE consisted mostly of whole families, the steppe migrations after 3500 BCE may have followed a pattern of a male warrior class first exploring or scouting out a new homeland, then mating with the indigenous females while forcing out or subjugating the indigenous males.

This is useful for working on some of the stories set on the main continent, and may be a useful origin story for the [[Monche Nomads]] although how they managed to find themselves on this island (or get off the island, with their horses...) would need a little extra thought.
