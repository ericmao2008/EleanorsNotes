I've been reading about [[sumptuary laws]] and I stumbled across some references to Korean royal clothing in [[6 Times Sumptuary Laws Told People What to Wear]] but even after chasing down a bunch of references from pop history articles, I'm still pretty confused.

Was there really an empress and a queen? I'm assuming these are just English words being slapped on a complex political situation with nuances that are being lost in translation, so I'm hoping someone can explain a bit more about the lives and ranks of women in the elite ranks Joseon Dynasty?
