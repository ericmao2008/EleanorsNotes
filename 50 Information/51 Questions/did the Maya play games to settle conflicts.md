- Asked [[rAskHistorians]], 

> I see this claim plastered all over my Google search results (I was looking for information about pre-Columbian stadiums in the Americas) but all of the sources seem really sketchy (travel websites, mostly) and the only thing I found about this game here on r/AskHistorians was an old question where the answer basically said the Inca didn't play it, but I can't find anything about whether the Maya really used the game in lieu of actually fighting a battle. Was this a real phenomenon?
> 
> I would love to teach about this when I do my Maya unit (my day job is world history teacher) but I do want to avoid perpetuating myths, and even searching JSTOR for "pok-a-tok" is yielding absolutely nothing.
