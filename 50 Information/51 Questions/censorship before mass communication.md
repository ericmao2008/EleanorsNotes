	- I've been thinking a lot lately about the tension between free speech and censorship and other than a brief mention of Socrates (which somehow feels like muddying the waters?) I wasn't able to find anything about the history of this tension. Do we know anything about ancient governments performing censorship of communications? Was that a thing? Or was it so normal and expected no one even really cared?
