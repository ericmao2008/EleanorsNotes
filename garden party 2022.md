## Invitation

The mostly-annual garden party aka Max's very merry unbirthday (we'll be unveiling a picnic table he got back in January) is happening! (unless there's a COVID spike, sigh. But we're gonna try)

It'll be on June 5: http://evite.me/YbMNwafSwe

(Don't worry about bringing a gift, the thing at the top is just an ad, but I can't find a better party-managing software and apparently evite got worse in the last 3 years. I wanted people to be able to see who was coming / discuss somewhere not Facebook since not everybody has facebook.)
