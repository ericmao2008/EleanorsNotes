# Games

> I'm working on a short fiction piece involving cheating at a big sporting event, but I want the game to be something unique and fun â€” I really do think that quidditch added a lot to the worldbuilding of Harry Potter, for example. To that end, I went and explored what sorts of common themes exist in games throughout cultures.  

## Quick Facts
 
- Material design of ancient board game ranges from elaborate jeweled boxes to scraps of leather moved across sketches in the dirt. 
- The ancient Egyptian game Mehen was played by ~6 people on a circular board that resembles a coiled snake. 
- [Hounds & Jackals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hounds_and_jackals) (aka 58 Holes) was popular for about 2,000 in ancient Mesopotamia and resembles nothing so much as cribbage; it's a "race" game involving dice rolls. 
- The Chinese "version" of chess (Xiangqi) is [played on the points of intersecting lines, instead of squares](http://ancientchess.com/page/play-xiangqi.htm). The [oldest variants](http://ancientchess.com/page/play-shatranj.htm) I'm aware of were played in Persian [and India](https://www.britannica.com/topic/chess/History) around the 7th century.
- Early Roman prohibitions against gambling came out of the pagan tradition; Christianity was very slow to develop anti-gambling dogma. 

## The Death of Games

Senet, which is played on a 3x10 grid of squares, is an ancient Egyptian board game played by Tutankhamun and Nefertari. It started out as a secular game, but developed ritual significance as a metaphor for the afterlife. It was [popular until the rise of Christianity](https://web.archive.org/web/20060712175805/http:/www.gamesmuseum.uwaterloo.ca/Archives/Piccione/index.html). 

## Replacement Games

Between 400 & 1100 CE, strategy games collectively known as Tafl were popular in Nordic countries. Game boards look a lot like hopscotch grids etched into a hunk of concrete, to be honest. It was [popular until the spread of Chess](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/best-board-games-ancient-world-180974094/).

## Gambling Lives

The Mesoamerican game of Patolli was played with remarkably high stakes; players sometimes wagered their freedom & their lives. The "board" was usually a mat (but could be sketched into the dirt); there were 70 spaces for pieces. Apparently [the government tried to discourage people from playing](https://www.mexicolore.co.uk/aztecs/home/gambling-and-patolli-the-aztecs-favourite-game). 

## Gambling Laws

Rome, by contrast, considered sports betting â€” betting on the outcome of chariot races or contests of strength â€” to be pretty much fine, a simple matter between friends â€” or a way to [encourage excellence in the soldering class](https://scholars.law.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1041&context=glj). It was _dicing_ games that led to a whole cottage industry. Laws against them were passed during the late Republic period, right around the time a bunch of other [sumptuary laws](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/sumptuary-laws/) %% [[2021.10.11 Sumptuary Laws]] / [[sumptuary laws]] %% were being passed. Justinian later codified more, to help curb corruption. %% [[farisChangingPublicPolicy]] %%
