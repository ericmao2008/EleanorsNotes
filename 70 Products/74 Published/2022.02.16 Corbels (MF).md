A young sailor tilted her head to the side and studied the golden walls of Nyandei. They towered over the nearby marsh, dwarfing every tree she'd ever seen. 

"Are there many wars here?" she asked, bloodthirsty and eager as only the innocent can be. "Barbarian attacks?" 

Her father — the ship's navigator, and the reason she was aboard — smiled indulgently. "No, Kayci. But you should see the city during flood season. Snowmelt runs right up to the top of the corbels, some years." 

"Why don't they move to higher ground?" 

Her father laughed. "Why, then they'd have to fight the barbarians."
