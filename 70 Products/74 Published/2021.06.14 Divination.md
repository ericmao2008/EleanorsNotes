# The sociopolitical implications of ancient divination

> On Friday, Inkblood Book Co. (which is in the process of publishing one of my flash fiction stories) posted a microfiction prompt (“liminal”) and I decided to [take part](https://twitter.com/EleanorKonik/status/1403400580672983045). So now I need to figure out how auguries & other forms of divination fit into the worldbuilding of my fictional universe. 

## Fun Facts
 
- Chinese oracle bones work by writing a question onto a (shoulder) bone (or turtle shell) and then touching it with red-hot metal; [the cracks were then interpreted](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2010/10/4/907558/-) by a shaman or king. 
- Unlucky days in Rome were sometimes the anniversaries historically significant defeats. %% [[dunlopAuguryDivinationRoman1987#p69 Unlucky days in Rome were historically significant defeats]] %%
- Looked at one way, ritually sacrificed animals were inspected by Roman priests for signs of ill health, then eaten by festival participants.  %% [[dunlopAuguryDivinationRoman1987#p69 Ritually sacrificed animals were inspected for signs of ill health then eaten]] %% 
- Both the Roman and Aztec capital cities had foundation myths centered around augury (signs provided by birds; vultures and eagle respectively). %%[[Malevolent Gods and Promethean Birds#p150 Rome’s founding was impacted by vultures as divination augury]]%%
- As with Odin and his ravens, Roman augury was centered around benevolent interactions between special mortals, gods, and particular avian messengers. %% [[Malevolent Gods and Promethean Birds#p151 Roman augury required benevolent interactions between priests gods and avian messengers]] %%

## A Cynical Veto
In Rome in the 50s B.C.E., abuse of religious obstruction became a politicized veto. Magistrates (previously unable to perform augury) no longer had to _see_ the relevant omen, they could just declare an intention to "watch the sky" in order to stymie the assembly; they didn’t even have to be present for the thing vote wanted stopped.

## Competing Auguries 
Part of the conflict between Romulus and Remus centered around augury interpretation. Six vultures came first to Remus, followed by twelve to Romulus. Their followers argued (and fought) about which was the more significant sign. Eventually, Romulus killed Remus.

## Friend to Foe
Although hunter-gatherers (and wolves!) value ravens for their scouting abilities and the way they can identify distant game, more settled populations often come to revile them for their propensity for scavenging meat from human corpses.  In ancient Ireland people believed their calls were prophetic; the goddess Athene “hated the raven for its powers of augury.” [[Read More](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26596516)] %%[[A Storytelling of Ravens by Betty Wheelwright]]%%

## Wedding Signs
Roman augurs were magistrates concerned with public, not private, affairs — with one exception: marriages. %% [[dunlopAuguryDivinationRoman1987#p68 Roman augurs were magistrates concerned with public not private affairs]] %% Mongolian marriage customs also include augury and the search for lucky signs on a chicken’s liver. They engaged couple can’t set a wedding date until they find the lucky sign.
