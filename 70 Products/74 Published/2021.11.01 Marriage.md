# ðŸ“— Marrying in, marrying out, & testing the waters

> Ever since I wrote [Liminal](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/furtive/) I've been thinking more and more about ancient marriage practices and how different ways of thinking about marriage can manifest in my storytelling. 

## Quick Facts
 
 * The Inca practiced _pantanacuy_, a "trial marriage" period of "premarital cohabitation" where the potential bride was tested for responsibility and household skills (and you betcha they had premarital sex, too). [The Augustinian missionaries were pretty upset about it.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3772990)
- Most civilizations in the Fertile Crescent treated [princesses as a diplomatic corps](https://eleanorkonik.com/ancient-princesses-ambassador/). 
- There was a strong cultural taboo against the daughters of Egyptian Pharoahs were being married off to foreign rulers. 
- In Ptolemaic Egypt, second- or third-generation Greek immigrants born in Egypt were most likely to marry outside their ethnic group. ([Source](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/army-and-society-in-ptolemaic-egypt/CE0AAFBE739C936317C3475C95A61E97))
- In Japan during the early Kamakura period, [marriage had no impact on a daughter's inheritance rights](https://www.jstor.org/stable/179066); she kept her name and her husband had no claim on her property. %%[[tonomuraWomenInheritanceJapan1990.pdf]] tonomuraWomenInheritanceJapan1990 %%

## Guilds to Castes

In West Africa's first "Commercial Age," villages would  specialize in different kinds of manufacturing, then sell products at a central market town. Ironworkers took this specialization to an extreme, creating so many taboos and rituals that they monopolized the skill, creating guilds. Leatherworkers and potters and other tradesmen started doing the same thing. They wanted to make sure their grandkids continued in the tradition and started marrying their kids to each other. So basically, one way castes can develop is basically through the marriage practices of monopolistic trade guilds. ([Source](https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/2705))

## Tradition Keepers

Wives who marry into a foreign tribe among tribal societies often feel so exposed and insecure that they become hyper-correct imitators of their new cultural mores. This is important because it offers a counterpoint to the idea that intermarraige between tribal groups might be a reason for changes in culture.

## Corruption

As clan chiefs in East Africa started to take advantage of their position to build enormous cattle herds around 1000 CE, strategic marriages helped them preserve power. The chiefs would contract marriage alliances with many families in different places in order to give those families a stake in the "new order." The rise of cattle-keeping also led directly to the elimination of women as chiefs. ([Source](https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/2705))

## No Equal

We don't know that much about [Ottoman harems](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mnk6yr/how_much_do_we_know_about_what_the_ottoman/), but they were basically large households. The harem of a prosperous household would include wives and/or concubines. Concubines were relatively high status but technically slaves. Once they had a child they couldn't be sold, and they were freed upon their husband's death. As the power of the Ottomans grew, sultans stopped taking wives entirely; subsequent rulers were all the children of concubines.
