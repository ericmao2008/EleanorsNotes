> Someone on r/AskHistorians asked about why students learn about theÂ [the Hapsburgs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ht1kue/the_hapsburgs_are_famous_for_their_defects_due_to/), but not Egyptian examples of inbreeding. Check out what I learnedÂ while sourcing my response and planning an article about creating fictional worlds withÂ inbred dynasties. 

## Quick Facts

- King TutÂ had a "juvenile aseptic bone necrosis" which made it hard for him to walk.
- Stillbirth was a common consequence of royal inbreeding.Â 
- Despite 300 years of inbreeding, theÂ Ptolemys didn't really have any major genetic issues.Â 
- Elissa of Tyre (aka Dido) was married to her uncle.Â 
- Incan princes often married their sisters.

## Incestuous Dynasties

Incestuous dynasties [were common](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/tut-dna-dobbs) inÂ ancient Egypt, Hawaii, the Incan Empire, pre-industrial Thailand, Phoenicia and several African realms. Incestuous European dynasties like the Hapsburgs tended to marry their cousins, whereas more [ancientÂ royal marriages tended to be between siblings](https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy201325).

## Saved By Polygamy

While yes, varieties ofÂ sibling marriage were common in Egypt, so was polygamy andÂ the [products of incestuous marriages](https://www.jstor.org/stable/644006) were not typically the heir. Marriages between individuals who grew up together young age are [typically sexless](https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/24/4/842/220309) due to something a type ofÂ sibling avoidance called theÂ Westermarck effect.Â
