2021-SEPT UPDATES

Hi everyone,

A couple of exciting updates. First, the kind folks at Ghost heard my tale of woe and offered to help me move to managed hosting, since their pricing structure has changed from when I first migrated to the service. So hopefully things should be smoother from here on out. 

Second, the monthly changelog & note-share is going to get moved from the last of the month to the first Friday of the following month. This will help avoid potentially sending you an two emails in one day, if of the last day of the month falls on a Monday or a Wednesday. 

As part of that minor timing change, new flash fiction (like this week’s _The Laundress & the Fungal Growth_)  will come out on the first Wednesday of the month. 

## CHANGELOG 2021-09

*Note: if you don't want to mess around with actually downloading my notes to poke through the [metadata](https://www.opendatasoft.com/blog/2016/08/25/what-is-metadata-and-why-is-it-important-data), but are curious about what they look like, most are also posted [here](https://publish.obsidian.md/eleanorkonik/).*

- I finished reading _In Search of the Phoenicians_ by Josephine Quinn. I wound up not making a bunch of atomic notes for it because it’s not that kind of book, but I did distill some of my reflections down into an article about [the nature of ancient identities](https://eleanorkonik.com/ancient-identities-complex-cultures/).  
- I have a *bunch* of new [atomic notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes_should_be_atomic). 
- I’m experimenting with controlled vocabularies (like professional librarians use for cataloguing) and the breadcrumbs plugin for my atomic notes. Not very far in yet, will report back next month. 
- I published [an article about folders vs. tags](https://eleanorkonik.com/yet-another-hot-take-on-folders-versus-tags/) and [an explanation of why Obsidian’s graph view is useful](https://eleanorkonik.com/its-not-just-a-pretty-gimmick-in-defense-of-obsidians-graph-view/). 
- I published [an article about the relationship between food storage and complex government](https://eleanorkonik.com/food-storage-complex-government/). 
- I have not had a chance to type up my notes for _Amazons_ by Adrienne Mayor :see_no_evil: but I did take a ton of notes about Assyria. 

## Plans for October

- Maybe I will type up my notes for _Amazons_ for real this time.
