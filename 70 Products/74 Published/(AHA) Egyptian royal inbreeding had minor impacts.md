Habsburg inbreeding comes up as a critique of European monarchy from a modern political standpoint. Since the US didn't fight any wars against Ancient Egypt and there haven't been any modern revolutions overthrowing ancient Egyptian dynasties, it wasn't relevant to any particular point education curriculums are concerned about making. 

That said, Egyptian royalty practiced inbreeding and it did have an impact. Although [stillbirths, genetic defects and disorders were definitely common](https://www.medicalbag.com/home/features/grey-matter/impact-of-royal-inbreeding-part-iii/), it's important to remember that inbreeding exacerbates "bad recessives" (I'm oversimplifying wildly, I'm not a geneticist, but work with me here) and if you start out with a clean enough gene pool and have enough kids to work with, you can wind up with a situation like the Ptolemaic dynasty, where Cleopatra was the result of a long line of inbreeding to keep the Macedonian bloodline pure, but didn't suffer any particular ill-effects from inbreeding. For example, a lot of dog breeds are really, really inbred, but although there are situations like how dalmatians are prone to hip dysplasia, that doesn't mean that _all_ modern purebreds are disease-ridden incompetents.

That said, about 10 years ago the Egyptian government gave scientists permission to do DNA studies on royal mummies, and it revealed that [King Tut (whose parents were siblings) had a disorder called juvenile aseptic bone necrosis](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/king-tut-dna/), which leads to bone damage as you might expect from the name.
