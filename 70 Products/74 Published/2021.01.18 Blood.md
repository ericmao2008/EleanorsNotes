# What kind of blood might a creature with an iron allergy have? 

I was working on an urban fantasy story years ago that featured elves, and I went pretty far down the rabbit hole on dangerous iron could be to them — including the iron in most terrestrial blood. I discovered that some animals have copper-based blood instead, but didn't do much with the concept until [Worldbuilding Magazine](http://worldbuildingmagazine.com/) asked me to put together a blog series about unusual animals to use as inspiration...

## Fun Facts

-   Proteins that actively use copper in their chemical makeup are rare: there are only about eight.  
-   Unlike hemoglobin, which is typically blue but turns red in the presence of oxygen, hemocyanin is clear until exposed to the air — then it turns blue.
-   Genetic alterations in blue blood is responsible for allowing the octopus to colonize the oceans, warm and cold.  
-   High levels of biliverdin (enough to kill a human) in the hemoglobin of Papua New Guinea's skinks turn the lizards' blood green.  
-   Hemocyanin is also thought to transport molting hormones in spiders.

## Vaccine Base

Hemocyanin is one of the strongest known antigens. Antigens are able to stimulate strong immune responses, so hemocyanin is often harvested from horseshoe crabs to help vaccine development. \[[Read More](https://biosyncorp.com/klh/introduction_to_hemocyanins/)\]

## Under Da Sea

Compared to hemoglobin, most hemocyanins (they aren't all the same!) are inefficient at transporting oxygen — except in cold, low-oxygen environments like the bottom of the ocean. \[[Read More](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/octopuses-survive-sub-zero-temps-thanks-to-specialized-blue-blood/)\]

## Colorless Blood

The ocellated icefish lives in such an oxygenated environment that it has neither hemoglobin nor hemocyanin; its blood runs clear. Its lack of scales and oversized heart help oxygen get through the body. \[[Read More](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/03/150312-blood-antarctica-octopus-animals-science-colors/)\]

## Allergic to Blue Bloods

People who are allergic to shrimp and crustaceans may actually be allergic to hemocyanin proteins. Hemocyanin is a cross-reactive allergen of crustacean, cockroach, and dust mites. \[[Read More](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/hemocyanin)\]
