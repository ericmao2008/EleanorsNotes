Hi everyone! 

First things first, as of last week I've officially moved over to Ghost(Pro) instead of self-hosting. There are a couple of small things that still need to happen behind the scenes, but hopefully all of the major changes are done.

This means that all subscribers of The Iceberg should be able to comment on posts, 

- [ ] change the pricing thing to include comments for everyone! 
- [ ] actually create the sample vault 

I'm also excited to announce that I'm going to be offering a _template_ for my organizational system for how I organize all my notes, that should hopefully be a little easier to navigate and offer more guidance than just my raw notes, which are still available [here](https://publish.obsidian.md/eleanorkonik/).

I wrote [Considerations for Fostering a Healthy & Active Online Community](https://eleanorkonik.com/considerations-for-fostering-a-healthy-active-online-community/) after several people asked for my opinion about how they could create healthy online communities for their software applications. 

One thing I did not touch on was _fan communities._ I think it's always a creator's hope that we can create a community of fans around our work — hopefully one that tempers honesty with kindness, enthusiasm with a recognition that creators do sometimes need to hunker down and "just write." 

To be clear I've never had any of these issues — I've only been sharing my stories for a couple of months, at this point — but I'm a fan of a lot of great creators with strong online presences, like Ursula Vernon, Seanan McGuire, and Ilona Andrews. 

Now that over 500 of you (!) are signed up to read this newsletter, I want to make sure that there was an easy way for folks to react to and comment on the research overviews, stories, analyses and updates I post. To that end, as part of the migration to managed hosting, I opened up commenting to all subscribers. You should be able to login using the email address you're subscribed to the newsletter with.
