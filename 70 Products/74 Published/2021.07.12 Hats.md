# Hats with pockets & other headgear to be jealous of

> My son’s unbirthday party was yesterday and we went with an Alice in Wonderland / silly hats theme because he’s been enjoying different kinds of hats, and it got me to wondering what kinds of hats the different cultures in my fantasy nations might favor.

## Hot Hats 

Not everyone is willing to wear hats appropriate to their climate. Sir Leonard Woolley was an archaeologist famous for wearing a sports jacket and felt hat while excavating Mesopotamian dig sites. Which is to say he walked around wearing a wool hat in the middle of the Iraqi desert. He did, however, discover the first archaeological proof of human sacrifice in Mesopotamia. %% [[Brotherhood of Kings by Amanda Podany#Sacral Queenship in Bronze Age Iraq]] %% [[Read More](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8358754-brotherhood-of-kings)]]

## Pointy Norms
Although today they’re usually associated with witches, birthdays, and klansmen and seem kind of ridiculous, conical and pointed hats were pretty common throughout history, especially on the Central Eurasian Plains. “Phrygian” caps like the ones given to freed slaves in Rome and worn by Frenchmen to symbolize freedom after the revolution are still found today adorning the heads of [fairytale dwarves](https://ghorbany.com/inspiration/the-phrygian-cap).
