## Quick Facts

- Only 13 animals were domesticated by early human societies.Â 

## Sex and Wine

Grapes in the wild generally have male and female vines. But the process of [domestication selected for hermaphrodism](https://phys.org/news/2020-06-uncovering-genetic-basis-hermaphroditism-grapes.html), which is a relatively rare genetic trait. It does, however, cultivation easier. Cabernet Sauvign isÂ the most widely planted wine grape cultivar in the world, incidentally.

## Foxes are the New Dogs

Urban foxes are showing the physical signs of domestication, but we didn't breed them on purpose. Their brains are smaller than their wild counterparts â€” but they're friendlier, which [keeps them alive](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-06-13/urban-foxes-are-evolving-that-s-good-for-homo-sapiens), which gives them more opportunities to breed. A third of an urban fox's diet is scavenged.Â

## Violence is Genetic

Male chimpanzeesÂ patrol their territorial borders in large groups and attackÂ lone chimps from neighboring communities, but isolated populations of apes and monkeys sometimes manage to [breed out violence](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/how-humans-tamed-themselves/580447/) by sexually selecting males whoÂ _don't_ patrol territory so they can beat up on the neighbors.Â Female bonobos form strong coalitionsâ€”partly based on sex with each otherâ€”that keep a lid on male violence.

## The Four Fs

Domestication works best when an animal is: [friendly, feedable, fecund, fast-growing, and family-oriented](https://www.reddit.com/r/CGPGrey/comments/48all2/zebra_vs_horses_americapox_part_2/). Farm animals like goats are domesticated. Circus animals like elephantsÂ are _tamed_. Zebras are harder to domesticate than horses because they don't have a family-based hierarchy system.Â Also, they have a ducking reflex, which makes them harder to lasso than horses.
