The Council closed the Akademe without saying why, but like all his fellow students, Neyik heard the rumors: the ancillary students left, and injured most of the senior professors in the process. 

Turned out "left" was code for "fled" which was itself code for "escaped" â€” from Akademe mages trying to create perfect soldiers.  Wolves who walked as men; men who walked as wolves, wielding swords and claws and able to fend off even the cruellest of armies. 

Or creators.
