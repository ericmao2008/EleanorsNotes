## Prose Chapter 02.2

Kia didn’t stop running until she reached the dangling rushes that marked the entryway into her family’s home. Mindful of her mother’s sensibilities, she wiped her tender cheeks with the sleeve of her dress and slowed her breathing.

When her hands stopped trembling, she plastered a triumphant smile on her face and walked inside. She held the basket she’d retrieved as though it was the only one she’d ever had.

The effect was wasted; Zahle lay sprawled across her weaving mat, her silky black hair splayed behind her head like a peacock’s tail.

Kia dropped the basket and crossed the room in a panic. Her first thoughts were of attack; had something (someone?) hurt her mother while she was away from the village?

But no—Zahle was breathing. Weakly, but her chest rose and fell. Had she fallen asleep waiting for Khent and Kia to come home?

No, that didn’t make sense either. Even crippled, Zahle could get upstairs to the beds on the roof. She never would have gone to sleep while her husband and child were out past dusk.

Besides, the noise hadn’t woken her. Maybe something louder? “I’m home,” Kia said.

Zahle made a soft noise in the back of her throat as her eyes, golden like the desert sands, fluttered open. “Oh good,” she said softly.

“What’s wrong?” Kia hoped it was just hunger; easily solved, for now. Hunger made people weak; the village struggled almost as much during the moon before the floods as they did before the harvests came in.

“Cold,” Zahle murmured.

Kia frowned, brow pinching in confusion; the house felt warm to her. She put her hand next to her mother’s exposed forehead; the heat of fever radiated back. Not just hunger, then. Her heart rose into her throat, choking her.

Too exhausted to cope with another crisis, Kia wanted more than anything to run and fetch help, to defer to her elders, but it was late, and she couldn’t bear to leave her mother alone.

Think, she ordered her sluggish brain.

This wasn’t the first time someone in Senva’s Ford had gotten sick; rote memory carried her body through the necessary steps as she forced her mind from the truth of the corollary: once they sickened, many died, even if a mender-mage was available.

Kia had only ever even heard of one; she would have to help her mother herself.

After she helped her mother to the roof, Kia tucked her under the linen blanket that defined her bedroll. Then she went back downstairs for the basket of meat and the small cedarwood box of medical supplies Zahle kept by the door. It wasn’t much: some sliced yarrow root, a sachet of dried marigold petals, a small pot of beeswax. The medicinal scent of tea tree oil permeated everything. Still, yarrow root tea would help with the fever.

“Where is your father?” Zahle asked after Kia finished grinding the bark to steep. Her voice was a whisper.

It was stupid to worry her mother during an illness, but she didn’t dare lie. “He’s fine. Hanok and Zesiro are helping him with the wyvern carcass we brought home.”

Zahle’s hands tightened around the heavy mug, her eyes fever-bright even in the moonlight. “A wyvern died in the river? Things must be—”

Kia swallowed. “No. It was in the desert.”

Zahle closed her eyes, the stern disappointment written into the lines of her face all the more powerful for the sickly paleness of her flesh. “You went into the desert.”

“And brought back food!” she didn’t mean for the words to come out so combative—Kia hunched her shoulders defensively, but Zahle must have been too weak to argue.

Miserable, Kia cut strips of wyvern meat and dried them on skewers over the fire banked in the hearth. She was almost finished when her father emerged into the light of the moon. He climbed the stairs empty-handed and frowned immediately when he saw the empty coals. “No stew?”

Kia flinched. The stew bits were in the basket she had left at the well. “I ran into Gyasi.”

Khent’s frown cleared. “You gave him half to take to his father?”

Kia swallowed, caught in uncertainty. If she told her father what had happened, he would be outraged; he would confront Gyasi’s father about the insult, the village would take sides. She had been at the well, at dusk, with her hair uncovered. She was past the time many women in her village had married.

She did not want to marry Gyasi. More importantly, the fishermen couldn’t afford to fight with the fellahin while the river ran so low. The family couldn’t fight while Zahle was so ill.

What if she doesn’t get better? She forced away the thought.

“He took the basket,” she agreed neutrally. It wasn’t quite a lie. He probably had.

Khent noticed Zahle, then, bundled in her blankets.

At least he’ll be too worried to–

Shame cut off the thought. To wipe it away, she blurted, “I made yarrow tea.”

"Has she had anything to eat?”

“I’m right here,” Zahle snapped, but her voice was weak.

“Not yet,” Kia said.

Her father looked relieved; that was something he could fix.

It was the first meat they’d eaten together in moons, but Kia couldn’t enjoy it. She wrapped her arms around her knees and watched the fire until the fullness in her belly lulled her into sleep.
