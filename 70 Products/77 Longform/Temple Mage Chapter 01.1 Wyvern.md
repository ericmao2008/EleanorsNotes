# Chapter 01.1

Kia watched her father check his traps and nets with a trembling in his muscles, a weakness in his limbs that shouldn't have touched a man not yet gone gray. Seeing him so frail weighted her stomach far worse than hunger, but it took Kia until the shadows hid beneath the noonday sun before she finally worked up the courage to ask, "What if waters don’t come?"

The river ran thin and shallow as it carved a tenuous path through the sloppy mud. Ten moons ago, it had sprawled across the Aakari basin, dense with life. Lush reeds had grown along its marshy banks, tall and plump and green. Now, only the stubborn songs of frogs and flies signaled hope of extracting a meal from the river's anemic embrace.

Her father’s shoulders tightened beneath skin stretched taut over unpadded bones, features twisting into a tired smile as he turned. "The Aakari will provide, Kia, as it always has. Sometimes it just takes a little longer, is all.”

“We’ll just have to stretch the harvest stores a little farther than usual?” she barely kept the sarcasm from her voice, but he nodded.

“That’s why you’re here helping me, and not your mother."

Khent patAlazar rarely lied, but when he did, it was always to protect his daughter from hard truths—and she always resented it. It was worse now that she had reached two hundred moons and stood beside him no longer a child. Still, Kia wasn’t quite brave enough to insist on the darkmoon truth they both knew: usually only sons accompanied their fathers with the fishing, and if there had been any reeds wet enough to weave, she would be back with her mother making baskets.

At least here on the river’s edge they could pretend her presence was productive.

"Come, Kia. There are more traps to check. Maybe we’ve caught something, eh?”

She’d watched him accept every misfortune their family ever faced with the same steady, useless platitudes, but somehow Kia still wanted to believe him. The mantle of adulthood sat uneasy on her shoulders, and maybe Khent was right. It was still early in the day. Surely something swam in the river; even the bottom-feeders would be welcome, now.

Though the heat and hunger sharpened her temper, she pushed her dark braids back under her scarf and offered a wan smile back. Khent often said there was no point in adding hurt hearts to aching bellies, and in this she believed him. “We’ll never know until we check.”

Relief hid behind the smile in his eyes as he handed over a shovel. Kia’s fingers tightened around its cedarwood handle, sturdy and worn smooth from seasons of use. As she used it to cut chunks of thick mud, lifting the sloppy bricks away from the basket they had buried that morning, she wondered: what would they do if the traps came up as empty as their nets?

Two hundred moons was old enough to know better than to ask. Kia hauled the mud block out of its hole, ignoring how her muscles protested at its weight, and pushed away the damp pats of mud. The slimy mess lacked the clean scent she remembered from the last time she’d helped repair the village levies; it was fishier somehow, thick with the musk of rot.

Under her father’s watchful eye—the pride there made her feel like the worst kind of hypocrite—Kia lifted the funnel-shaped lid from atop the narrow-necked basket. Inside, the morning's catch splashed frantically as the sun struck the water inside. Two crabs, each smaller than her palm, a few small snails she recognized as toxic, and—a fish! Disappointment warred with wonder as she identified it as a moonfish by the fluttering of its flat wing-like fins. Each scale glimmered like an opal in the harsh light, but hunger won and she said nothing as she dumped it into a watertight basket near the bow of the boat. It joined the rest of the day's meager catch where it wouldn’t rot in the hot sun.

Khent exclaimed when he saw the opalescent moonfish. "See? The river provides!"

Kia’s stomach rumbled, a gnawing void that fought to cripple her. "We can't eat any of this."

"The shellfish will make a good stock." Kia shuddered at the words, but Khent didn't seem to notice. "We can use the snails as bait, and moonfish scales are very valuable. It is a good catch."

His constant optimism was too much to take, and something in her snapped. "What good is money when nobody will part with any food?" No one in the village, anyway.

"Everything has a use, Kia." The gentleness of his tone made Kia want to scream, but she recognized the Imazi proverb and it gave her an idea.

“I bet the Imazi aren’t hungry.”

Khent frowned for the first time all morning. “Kia, your mother’s people face hardships too, just like all—”

“I know.” She cut him off. “Mother lost her legs in the desert or she would have never come to live in Senva’s Ford. I know the family history, and I know it’s dangerous. But there aren’t any fish to eat because floodwaters haven’t come to drive back the desert. The Imazi live in the desert from the long night thru the long day. If there isn’t any food in the river, we should look in the desert.”

She had never seen his eyes look so dark as when he said, “The Imazi don’t come here anymore. Maybe—"

Kia shook her head. “Jisge’s bridge took our trade. It didn’t change the desert.”

After a long moment, he sighed. “If I refuse to take you into the sands?”

Kia squared her shoulders. “I will go without you.”

He closed his eyes, then nodded wearily. "Help me clean up."

Kia felt a strange sense of pride as she carefully tugged the snail from its shell and chopped it against the rim of the boat. Together they rebaited the traps, then stowed their gear in the dugout. When her father was a boy, he and his brothers traveled all the way to the highland forests to find a tree suitable for boat-building. Khent, the eldest, inherited it when her grandfather passed beyond the veil.

When they finished loading the boat, Khent’s expression more somber than Kia had ever seen, even when the last of his brothers poled away north. "If you come to harm in the desert, your mother will never forgive me."

“I’ll be careful,” she promised, but inside her heart leapt.

"Two hundred moons," he said with a crooked smile, slightly pained. "You are no longer bound by a child's rules, but the rules were for a reason. The desert is dangerous, Kia."

“It’s dangerous to keep pretending that everything will be fine if we just wait,” Kia said firmly, proud that the words hadn’t come out as an accusation. They would wither with full bellies on shell stew and scale soup. Safe on the river meant safety to starve.

A muscle in his cheek jumped, but Khent nodded and took the tow-rope.
