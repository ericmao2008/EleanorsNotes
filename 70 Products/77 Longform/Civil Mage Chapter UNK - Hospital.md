The garrison’s physician reported that Rimush wasn’t doing well. 

Arminia should have known his name; they both served the Architect, albeit in different ways. [Arhictect built cities, requires sanitation and healing to build population, population density, some kind of mythology. Short infodump.]

The physician on duty inspected the perrexo. He looked surprised. “These are good quality spores.” 
Dendari tightened his lips; Arminia wondered if he was offended, but why would he be? The physician had complemented him. 
"What does it do?" Knofre asked, leaning over the pouch to take a sniff of the medicine inside. 
Immediately, he gasped for breath. His face swelled, faster than Arminia would have thought possible. The veins of his cheeks broke under the skin, leaving him red.  
“Poison!” Urush shouted. He drew his sword and lunged toward Dendari, who leapt backwards. 
"No!" Arminia exclaimed. 
Dendari had an axe at his belt, but he didn't draw it. 
Arminia swept her gaze around the hospital looking for a guard, or a soldier visiting a friend; anyone who could safely intervene. But the ward was empty, everyone busy because of the tribal visit. "What is happening?" she demanded of the physician, who had already pressed Knofre to sit on the bed. 
"An allergy," the physician said tersely. 
"Is he going to be okay?" 
"I don't know. Probably." 
"Urush!" Arminia shouted in her most imperious voice. "Stop!" 
He ignored her. 
She jumped between them before she had time to consider whether it was a good idea. "It's medicine," she shouted. "Not poison!"
Dendari shoved her out of the way. Arminia stumbled, turned back to the fight, and was horrified to see Urush's blade buried in Dendari's shoulder.  Behind him, Rimush forced himself into a sitting position. The dog barked. 
Arminia grabbed Urush by the shoulders and pulled him bodily off balance, for once grateful for her greater height. 
"Listen!" she shouted at him, then turned him toward the physician. 
The gaped for a moment as he looked up from his patient and saw the tableau, but realized quickly enough what Arminia wanted. “It’s an uncommon reaction, but it happens. Some people are allergic to the spores. It’s would best if Knofre returns to his bunk and lays down for a little while before I continue treating Rimush.”
"He won't be able to make it on his own," Arminia said to Urush. She had learned over the years that most soldiers did best with firm directions for how to help. "Why don't you take him to his bunk?" 

Arminia counted out sixteen stamped hedj; it was most of the month’s salary allowance, and she didn’t care. Not if it meant Rimush was more likely to recover. 



“Please escort Trader Dendari back to his inn,” Arminia said to Urush. 
They both looked startled. “I don’t need—” Dendari said.
Urush spoke at the same time “My assignment was—” 
Arminia sliced her hand through the air. “A Voldshee walking through the garrison without an escort is bound to cause trouble. I’m perfectly safe here. Rimush isn’t going to let anything happen to me, right?” She pasted on a bright smile. 
Rimush chuckled, a dry, hacking sound. “In the unlikely event that we’re attacked, I certainly don’t intend to stay in this bed and die.” 
Arminia smiled brightly. “There, see?”
