## Whole Story 
she has the opportunity to defy orders, but decides not to . That's the refusal of the call, when she doesn't think Valencia would support her against Temple leadership. She backs down instead of staying and helping in the Marna... Even though Wanishtu has asked her to abandon the temple and work with him and the loyalists to serve marna's interests. 

Her refusal is to abandon the capital for the army because she thinks she has nothing to contribute in the capital and will only hurt Valencia and her friend one ish to, she thinks he's wrong that she is an asset for him. She thinks that she is only good for breaking sieges and asks the high priest for permission to serve in the army's interests?? 

start out with a vester trying to send her away, then she runs into one each too. She initially blows off the high priest by basically telling her that Aaron Murphy is not even in the ground yet and if he tries to send her away before the memorial she'll kill him or something to that effect. He tells her that she has until she's finished the memorial service to decide, but that if she stays she will be punished for what she did in the market square. Sending her to the army is meant to be his compromise allegedly. If she stays and things will be worse for her personally. 

The big acceptance of the call moment happens in brookside when she decides to start helping the little people again instead of running away. 

Scene to needs to end on the note of Irella looking over to Valencia and trying to get her to intercede, and then Valencia deliberately looks away.
