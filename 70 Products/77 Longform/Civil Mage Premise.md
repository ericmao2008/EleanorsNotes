#fic/editPending  -- amend to: 

Patience leads to victory.  
  
They acted too soon in killing Eramepi.  
If she'd waited a day Valentia wouldnt have had to send her away.  
If she'd waited in marna for the goods she would have avoided the raid and been protected by Wanishtu.  
The monchr waited for valentia and [[Irella]] to come thru so they won.  
The brookside monche attacked before they should have so they lost.  
Brookside was patient with the empire so they won.
