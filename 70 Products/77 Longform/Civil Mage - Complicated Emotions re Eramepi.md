He stole you

What am I supposed to do with that information? He raised me, cared for me, protected me, gave me a joke, made sure I was taught

He was using you

He wasn't just using me! 

Sometimes you don't get closure. Things aren't black and white. He wasn't good or evil. He just was. You don't figure it out and put your emotions into a neat little box. You just think about it less and less as you move on with your life. 

My life is building things! Making life better for people. Stopping pointless wars and uniting people in a common cause. 

Do you think that makes you great? Or does it just mean you've found a way to cope with having no family to fulfill you?
