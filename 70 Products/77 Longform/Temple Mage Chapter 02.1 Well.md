# Chapter 02.1 

Kia came to with her father’s hand on her face, a shocking breach of etiquette.

Wake up, wake up, Zahle will murder me if I—

No one had touched her skin since she was old enough to bathe and dress herself. No one was supposed to until she married. The contact tingled on her cheek.

Khent snatched his hand away as soon as she opened her eyes. His long, angular face was inches from her own, and she had to suppress the hysterical impulse to bop the button of his chin, like she was a child again. Embarrassed, she looked away. The sky had darkened, not enough to become dusky, but it wouldn’t be much longer before blue faded into orange on the horizon.

Everything smelled like copper.

She lifted herself up into a sitting position, feeling fuzzy. Only when she put her hands in her lap did she realize they were covered in blood. She stared. It was dry.

She looked up with a start. “Are you okay?” The words tumbled out of her mouth.

Khent nodded. Nothing broken.”

She managed to breathe. “The wyvern?”

He gestured into her periphery. “It’s dead.”

His voice was pinched with stress, but Kia nodded, relieved. She didn’t even want to think about how awful it would have been for the creature to escape. The idea of that much wasted meat was enough to make her shudder. “Let’s take it home, then.”

Khent hesitated. “Your mother—”

“Will be happy to have a full belly,” Kia said firmly, though she knew Khent was right to fear her mother’s temper.

Just as he knew she was right that they couldn’t pass up the food. Still, the attack had drained his usual enthusiasm. “It will be heavy.”

A crooked smile twisted Kia’s lips. “It will be easier to deal with dead than alive.”

Khent snorted agreement as Kia rocked to her feet. She let her vision clear for a moment, then saw it: the wyvern’s body lay a few steps away. Even where the crusted salt remained white, untouched by the pooling blood, signs of struggle were unmistakable. She could read its death throes in the ripples of the earth.

Her own story lay written there as well; her headscarf sprawled torn and stained in the crimson puddle. She retrieved it and packed it into the basket. Though she couldn’t bear the thought of wearing it, fabric was too valuable to abandon.

They packed everything but the rope and trussed the wyvern so its wings wouldn’t flop while they moved it.

Her father was right—the wyvern was heavy. By the time they finished dragging it up to the boat, and then traversing the dunes west of Senva’s Ford, she was all but limping. With the weight of the trussed carcass, the dugout bit deeper into the sands, and the walk home was achingly slow.

Both of Kia’s shoulders burned; the left because of her fall, and the right from the angle she was forced to use to pull her share of the load. Sweat dripped down her chin despite the deepening evening chill, and she nervously watched for the snakes and scavengers bound to emerge as the shadowed deepened.

“At least we don’t have to worry about hyenas this close to the village,” Kia said, remembering one of her mother’s stories about a group of the scavengers attacking an Imazi camp when she was a girl.

“No sense worrying,” Khent agreed. She walked several more steps before she realized he hadn’t actually agreed that they were safe.

When the levee came into view over the last hill, she had to fight not to sink to her knees in relief.

“Can we butcher it here?” Kia asked as she confronted the steps that led over the levee. The embankment was taller than she was, and steep; there was no way she could haul the whole wyvern carcass up the stairs into the village.

Her father shook his head wearily. “Soon. We should butcher it down by the river.”

It didn’t take long to get to the water, but every step in the shadow of the levee felt twice as hard now that she was so close to home. Still, Kia didn’t complain as she helped her father wipe down the hide with river water, then string up the carcass above a wide-bottom basket to catch the blood.

"Hold it steady,” Khent told her, then skinned it with the same practiced efficiency he used to fillet a fish, pausing to sharpen his knife while the blood drained from an arterial cut. Kia hated blood oats, but the village couldn’t afford to waste food this far past the harvest. She would eat it and be grateful, if it came to that.

"What do you want me to do with the hide?” Kia asked once he finished cutting it loose.

“Lay it flat for now and get another basket for the meat.”

Kia complied, packing away the backstrap first, then the long loins from its sinuous tail.

Once he gave her the hunk of meat from each jaw, he stopped to study what remained. “That’s enough for you to take to your mother for now. Stop at Hanok’s on your way and let him know I’ll need his help, and to bring his bonebreaker.” Fishermen didn’t usually need cleavers, but half the villagers were fellahin. Every now and then an ox proved too fractious for the plow and had to put down; Hanok was the only villager strong enough to do it right. “Tell Zesiro to bring his salt and the scraper, too. He’ll want the hide.”

Kia nodded, then glanced westward. It blazed red with the sun’s rage. “Should I come back with them?”

Khent shook his head. “Stay with your mother. She’ll want to know what happened.”

The cynical part of her knew he was hoping she could blunt her mother’s temper; the caring daughter was willing, but more worried about the shadows under his eyes and the greyness to his skin than the sharp edge of her mother’s tongue.

Nonetheless, she obeyed, taking a basket under each arm. The temptations offered on the other side of the levee were too strong to resist. The scent of cookfire coals smoldering awakened the hunger that fear, exhaustion and time had suppressed. Without any further questions, Kia climbed the stairs up and over the earthworks and entered the village she had seen through fifteen floods.

The houses were mostly single-story buildings of thick mud brick, though a few of the larger families had expanded as people moved away and land safe behind the levee became less dear. Many were outside, enjoying the faint breeze that offered respite from the day’s heat. Kia nodded to a few, but was too tired to offer more than a few words of tired greeting, except to Henok and Zesiro. Their wives would spread word of her request; she didn’t have the energy to share the triumph herself.

In a proper town, like Jisge had become, the houses would have been finer—taller, if nothing else. But then she would have had to shout to greet her neighbors, if she knew them at all.

Kia paused briefly at the well in the center of the village, setting down the baskets beside a fresh heap of dirt that hadn’t made it to the levee yet. The well must have gone dry again; even freshly deepened only a few inches of liquid pooled at the bottom. If the floods didn’t come soon, they would be forced to risk the plagues by drinking the river water.

For now, though, she was relieved to be able to wash away the salt and sand and blood before she saw her mother. What the dusk hid from her neighbors, Zahle would notice immediately.

“I’ve never seen your hair before.”

Kia’s hand flew to her head, and she realized her scarf was still missing. She’d forgotten it in the long, hard slog from the salt basin, and now she cursed herself for the oversight as she turned to face Gyasi. She had to look up; Gyasi was one of the tallest men in the village, though he was still gawky with his height. Everyone said that soon, he would start to fill out like his father, but Kia hoped not. He was arrogant enough as it was.

“It’s almost dark,” Kia said, looking around for anyone else to deflect his attention, but the nearby rooftops were empty; the most prosperous families had been among the first to leave. “What are you doing here?”

“Talking to you.” He grinned and took a step toward her, cheeks flush with excitement. “Did you finally get tired of your father pretending you’re a son?” He frankly appraised her, but somehow managed to ignore the scrapes on her cheeks, the sweat stains on her clothes. She wasn’t surprised; Gyasi looked at her often—he rarely saw her.

“Actually, he sent me ahead with meat.” Maybe she should have responded more demurely, but she was tired and wanted to wash her face and go home a lot more than she wanted to appease his ego.

The avarice in his eyes shifted from her body to the baskets; he lifted a lid and peeked inside. “Where did you get meat? The herders aren’t selling.”

She lifted her chin, pride stiffening her spine. “From the desert.”

He smirked, then. “You’ll have to pay the desert tax, then.”

She was too confused to be angry. “What?”

“A tenth part of everything the Imazi bring into town. It’s what Jisge charges the Imazi to use the bridge. I talked it over with everyone and we decided it only makes sense to do the same here.”

Everyone was almost certainly limited to his friends among their age-mates; she glanced around, wondering if they were close. “I’m not Imazi.”

Gyasi sneered. “Of course you are.” He reached out quickly enough that she couldn’t stop him from touching her hair. “Of course, if you married a proper fellahin, we could overlook your bloodline.”

She tried to recoil, but he closed his grip around her braids. Fear shot into her belly; exhaustion fled. She tried to back up, but bumped into the well; she gasped at the impact. Outrage overwhelmed fear. She glared at him. “Let me go!” She raised her voice, but no one called out. No one came.

“I’m tired of letting you go! You should have been mine moons ago.” The scent of garlic underscored the force of his words.

“I need to go home.” She tried not to panic.

“You aren’t going anywhere until I’m done with you.” His eyes glittered. “Your cousins aren’t here to interfere anymore, Kia.”

“My mother—”

“Nobody in Senva’s Ford is afraid of your mother’s Imazi friends.”

“Do you think being awful to my mother is going to make me more likely to marry you?”

“Hey, I’m not the one who made her a useless cripple.”

Rage burned in her chest; her mother was the best weaver in Senva’s Ford, hardly useless.

She pushed him. Her shoulder screamed, but she ignored the pain.

He slapped her across the cheek, then grabbed her shoulders. Pain shot down her arm like a flash of lightning. Even through her robes, his fingers bruised her skin.

Shock pushed through her anger. “My father—”

“—is an old fisherman with a crippled wife,” Gyasi spat. “My father is the strongest farmer in this village. Everyone knows the only reason we have any food at all is because my family cleared new fields this last season.”

It wasn’t true; they had meat, now. Kia glared at Gyasi and refused to be intimidated. “I killed a wyvern today.” She wasn’t sure whether she meant the statement as mere disagreement or a threat, but it surprised him. His grip went slack.

She flung herself to the side, breaking free. Only one basket was in reach; she grabbed it and bolted, cursing herself for a coward as she ran.
