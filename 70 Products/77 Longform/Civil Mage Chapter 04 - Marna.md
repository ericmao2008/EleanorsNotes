## Summary

[[Irella]] arrives in Marna and heads to the palace to meet with Wanishtu's father, the Governor, in hopes that she can offer help on her way to Uskune. Angry crowds outside the palace are shouting about how Eramepi abandoned them and how they want the Governor to stop spending their sons and resources for Oruku — when they see Irella, they shift into a mob and Irella is forced to retreat to the Temple, where she is horrified that public sentiment has so thoroughly turned since she was last in the city. Her mentor explains that she suspects outside influencers are trying to stir up problems in Marna, and urges Irella to keep her head down and let the Governor handle the unrest, but instead Irella confronts them and gives a speech about how supporting the League *is* helping Marna and that everything Eramepi did was to make the region safer for their sons, not to make them die in pointless foreign wars. She defuses enough of the tension that she is able to leave safely — to the jeers of those who say that she, too, is abandoning them. This time, Irella keeps walking. 

## Notes

- [ ] The gate guard was given a message for Irella warning her about raiders and asking her to stay. Interprets it as another attempt to get her to indulge in treason, and elects to go forward. Is basically like if you're really worrying about me you would give me an escort, and the guard is like we can't spare anyone with the current uncertainty. Irella is frustrated because the uncertainty is entirely self-inflicted.
- [ ] In [[Marna]], the gate guard could recognize her and try to refuse to let her leave until she's talked to the Governor. She could bull through, suspecting rebellion... but in fact they're trying to *stop* Lupicin's rebellion... but couldn't convince Valentia to Act first. Wanishtu would have told her this if she'd stayed on Oruku. 
- [ ] Irella tries to get to the Governor but failing and falling afoul of protesters - she is basically driven to the temple where the mentor gives her a choice: wait out the crowd or confront them. The mentor warns that the crowd has been egged on by propogandaists who may be working for General Lupicin, who was given control of Uskune as a concession to Keldehhs - tho he was one of Eramepis' generals during the Unification War, he's widely viewed as a "jump on the bandwagon" ambitious guy, not a loyalist -- and his sister married Sargov's successor. 
- [ ] Move Rimush' introduction to him being foisted on her by the Temple at the end of the conflict at the Temple. 
- [ ] Find whether the Temple scene with the whole "the temple was easy to identify because it was so big" still appears in a previous chapter. If possible, move it. 
- [ ] Remove the reference to Irella having picked up gear; if she were going to do that she should have traveled with Wanishtu after all.

title: Implement
Somebody tells her that her mistake is that she just doesn't do what she's told, and she thinks to herself that no the problem is that she doesn't have enough power to support doing what she knows is right. That's the epiphany of the core of the book, that's where she goes against her mentor, because your mentor is telling her that she needs to just go on to uskune. 

She rejects that, and helps the governor. 

The subversion is that the high priest in Marna who she looks up to for her whole life is not the mentor in the scene, the governor is, he gives her key information about how to manage the political situation in the North in exchange for her assistance

# Chapter  04

By flatboat, it took all ten days of the decan for Irella to get to Marna, the Lysar River’s northernmost port. The eastern boatman led his oxen up and over the towbridge toward the stone dock. His wife set aside her knitting as they pulled into port, which Irella took as a signal to stand and stretch her legs. Beside her, Enduca did the same. 

The *biladiyn* had been assigned to as Alem's subordinate in guarding Irella, ostensibly because Irella's mission was potentially dangerous but actually because en-Tirigan had been furious about how she'd handled the confrontation at the sewers. It was one of many petty revenges the Engineers had wrought for their trip, which Irella had been helpless to prevent. 

Enduca seemed to accept her new assignment philosophically enough, but Irella didn't quite trust the calm facade, and so her guilt over being responsible for wrenching the *biladiyn* away from her home in Oruku was compounded by her guilt for not trusting a woman who had by definition dedicated her life to protecting thaumaturges like Irella.

"It'll be good to get back on land again," Alem said as he joined them. 

Irella offered a crooked smile, but said nothing as the boatman tied up at the pier. Unlike the senior *biladiyn,* she hadn't minded spending ten days sleeping on the open deck, dependent on others to make decisions about their path and progress. So she thanked the boatman and his wife, promised to speak well of them to her superiors in Marna, and disembarked. 

"Which way?" Alem asked.

Irella gestured toward the palace. "I promised Wanishtu I would check in with his father before I went on to Uskune."

Irella suppressed a twinge of discomfort as a flicker of surprise crossed Enduca's face. A priestess in her position would normally report to the Temple, not the palace, and she had been criticized in the past for her close relationship with the nobility.  The same people, of course, completely ignored how intertwined the the Temple of the Engineer had become with the nobility of [[Keldehss]] when they controlled access to the copper trade, and the way the Archivist's Temple in Pontero had an *especially* close relationship with the nobles who trade in clay. %% cuneiform is definitely not do-able on papyrus, that's probably *why* the Egyptians invented hieroglyphics %% Irella was bitterly certain that if she had been Valentia's daughter or Wanishtu's sister, no one would have batted an eye at her support for Eramepi. The miracles she wrought would have been proof that the Architect favored Eramepi's efforts to be a civilizing force, and nothing more. 

The farther they got from the docks, the fewer chickens and dogs they passed, until finally they were mixed in with the two- and three- story homes of the artisans and traders.

"Do you hear that?" Enduca said.

Confused, Irella stopped walking and focused. The noise she had taken to be the usual dull furor of trade, of women chatting as they filled jugs from a nearby fountain, of children shrieking as they chased chickens from their roosts was not, in fact, so mundane.

Now that Enduca had pointed it out, the sound was deeper, that of a crowd, not a group — and it was coming from the direction of the palace, not the market.

"Might be soldiers having a parade?" Alem said doubtfully. 

Irella, who had probably seen more parades than a *biladiyn* from Oruku even if she was younger, shook her head. "They sound angry." 

"Is there a back way to the palace?" Enduca asked. 

Irella frowned, then nodded. 

It looked like she would be checking in at the Temple first after all. 

---

Each of the six gods of Nahria boasted a Temple in Marna, but the Temple of the Architect was by far the tallest. Even if Irella hadn’t lived in the Temple of the Architect since coming to Oruku, it would have been impossible to miss. Constructed by magic out of glittering blue [[aetherrock]] barely distinguishable from the clouds above, tall enough that it would have required a massive base to support its bulk had it been built of any other material. Together, the six levels of the Temple formed a stairway for the gods' journeys to the heavens. 

A pair of workers sat in front of the entrance to the Temple, chatting as they ate sour fish balls straight from their skewers. Irella passed them with her escort. They paid her no mind as she walked by, the sight of a priestess and her guards returning to Temple too common to note. 

Irella was the only thaumaturge in service to the Architect east of Ulmes, but there were hundreds priests of the Architect in Marna alone. 

She counted seven in the main hall as she entered the Temple. Most met with petitioners, but Irella smiled to see one priestess teaching a pair of children, too young to be novices, how to build a strong wall out of miniature blocks. 

The lemon-ash scent of incense filled her nostrils, teasing her memories with a history of safety and purpose edged with the omnipresent scorn she had endured since arriving at the Temple at the age of eight. With the might of the temple—of the Architect Himself—behind her, she need not fear famine, or slavery, or abandonment. The only thing she had to fear was the high priest and his orders—and the judgment of her peers.

The first thing she heard was a prayer; a woman’s family home had been destroyed in a recent spate of flooding out in the countryside. Irella couldn’t help but envy the priestess who would be tasked to help the woman. 

The work Irella specialized in was important, and the speed she could bring to a task with the Architect's grace often-critical, but it was also mostly thankless. The people who understood and appreciated the import of her projects had been too powerful, too absorbed in managing the world, to really be *grateful* for the beneficence of the Architect. 

Guilt flooded her at the thought. She didn't serve the Architect because she wanted *gratitude.* She did good work, and that was precisely what the Architect demanded of His followers. Safe bridges, unobtrusive piping, their whole purpose was to provide frictionless infrastructure — Irella's job was to make sure nothing *went* wrong, not enjoy the kudos that came from fixing an issue that had already escalated to being a problem. 

Still, though Irella was one of the strongest thaumaturges in the Architect’s service, and capable of far more impressive work than simple home repairs that even an acolyte could make without magic, she would rather help a fishwife than embellish a market to overawe foreign traders. 

No matter how much Lysaria needed the trade. 

A voice stopped her just before she left the entrance hall. "You're back. I thought you were set on reforming the capitol." 

Irella jerked, startled to hear such a snide tone in such a sacred place. "The Architect bids us to know when to adapt construction to the land, and when to adapt the land to construction, nin-Johsti."

She didn't stay to continue the confrontation; let Johsti follow her, if she wanted to embarrass herself further. Heroic statues dwarfed her as she passed beyond the public spaces, a sensation that was, as always, at once comforting and intimidating. Light from the sun, diffused by the thick panes of aetherock that defined the outer building, became a memory as she passed through the vestibule into the dark stone rooms that defined the sacred portion of the Temple. 

"Grab a lantern," Irella told Alem. Without a word, he picked up a ceramic lamp from a shelf by the door and lit the oil-soaked wick. %% source: https://www.mpm.edu/research-collections/anthropology/anthropology-collections-research/mediterranean-oil-lamps/description-and-history-oil-lamps ##followup for a [[Newsletter Ideas]] entry %%

"Where are we going?" Enduca asked the third time Irella turned a corner. 

Irella shook her head. Though they were probably alone—this part of the Temple mostly housed old tablets, mostly maps, schematics and records—she didn't like the idea of discussing high-order Temple secrets aloud where novices could overhear. 

A few hallways later, tucked away in a small room that housed a collection of surveying rods owned by past thaumaturges, there was a spiral staircase. Only when she had closed the door behind her did Irella explain. "This room is restricted to thaumaturges and the High Priest, though, so please don't mention it to the any *biladyin* other than your own Order Head." 

"*Biladiyn* don't gossip, nin-Irella," Alem said, his tone almost paternal. 

Enduca snorted a laugh. "You've never passed along potentially critical information to the next member of the Order to take over a duty?" 

"That's not the same—"

"That's precisely what I'm asking you not to do," Irella said firmly, and started to climb.  

Several levels later, the stone transitioned back to aetherock and fresh air cut through the incense that clung to her skin and robes. This part of the building wasn't roofed and as they climbed, the shadows lightened until finally Alem asked permission to extinguish his lamp. 

They emerged from the staircase onto a simple aetherock landing, the sun overhead and the Lysar River winding through the countryside to the west. It was her favorite view in the world,  grayish blue bordered by lush emerald greens that the even finest weavers and wax painters had no hope of replicating. 

Aetherrock, only slightly darker and slightly heavier than the sky itself, wasn't just a miraculous material for building Temples. It made an unparalleled bridge, too. 

"You're planning to walk across that." Alem's tone was flat, almost unfriendly. 

"You're crazier than the Engineers," Enduca said, her laugh holding only a tinge of hysteria.

At least they hadn't refused.

The Governor's Palace in Marna was, in the broad strokes, of typically Nahrian construction. This was to say that even though it ostensibly housed all of the bureaucratic necessities of governance, it was still a residence and thus still boasted a courtyard at its center. 

At the center of the palace courtyard in Marna stood an observatory, which had confused Irella the first time she saw it—the study of stars was work for the Archivist's priests, not political leaders. As she left stepped off the skyroad, accompanied by the sound of Alem's slowly-released breath and Enduca's quiet chuckle, she remembered how Eramepi had explained that the tower had initially been intended to serve as a watchtower until one of his predecessors had taken an interest in a particular priestess and had it converted for her use. The memory of his droll tone, filled with self-deprecating humor aimed at his ancestors and his position, hit her like a  


A later ancestor had added the sky-roads out of paranoia, and for the most part, the paranoia of rulers she knew of had served them well. 

Now,

Avestur wanted her gone because he couldn't control her. Valentia wanted her gone because she couldn't control the people who hated her. Wanishtu and his father were the only ones to seek her help, and she didn't dare give it. 

Not in such a critical moment for the future of the League.

If Valentia couldn’t hold the cities together, the peace they had worked so hard to build – a peace that marauders and slavers did not dare disturb – would crumble. Eramepi’s legacy would crumble. The incessant, petty raids would pick up and another generation would be left starving or orphaned or both. 

Irella was going to Uskune. 

- - - 

"Wanishtu said the city was having some trouble," Irella said when she was finally escoted into the Governor's presence. %% Name him %%

As Governor, his time was precious. But in Marna, at laest, the palace functionaries were discinlined to stand in Irella's way. Not after [[2021.06.02 Beetle Siege (FF)|the siege]]. 

$NAME$ barked a bitter laugh and gestured toward the mob, visible through the second-storey window. "You could say that," $NAME$ said. "[[Eramepi]]'s death has made people scared—and ambitious." 

"How can I help?" Irella asked. She couldn't stay—there wasn't much time before the [[Monche Nomads]] were due to arrive in [[Uskune]], but she couldn't just abandon the people who had succored her, either—politics be damned. 

%% Need to have a consequence for the delays. Monche already there? Raids she could have defended against! %% 

"The east bridge is down," $NAME$ said. 

Irella shook her head. "That would be a 2 day round trip — I need to get to Uskune."

"You're kidding. You're going to help *General Lupicin?* He's a (backstory)."

"I'm going to help *Valentia,*" Irella said flatly. 

"Do you hear all of those people? They don't care about the League. They care that Eramepi and Valentia abandoned then and now they're %% what? starving? trapped because of the bridge? Losing out on opportunities? Now their sons are dying in border wars with people they've never heard of, so Valentia can wear an overlord's crown? %% 

"You know why Eramepi founded the league, $NAME$! You were there the day we decided to do it." 

"I know, but I have to answer to the people too, Irella. And the whole point was to stop the skirmishing. Now we're even worse off than we ever were: 
- monche raids
- army fa away
- royal family pouring money and talent into Oruku while Marna bleeds. 

"Are you really bleeding so very badly?" 

"Trade with Uskune has tried up now that Lupicin is in charge."
