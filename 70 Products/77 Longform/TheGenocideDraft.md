# The Genocide Draft

## 1. Sharpshooter [D]

There was something soothing about looking at the world through a rifle scope. It narrowed his focus. Lent a certain objectivity.

The tip of the rifle barely moved as Demetrius studied the crowd below, a thousand people gathered for the graduation ceremony of the newest crop of clairvoyants coming up through the Academy of Psychic Sciences. From his perch in an ancient bell tower, he couldn't hear the valedictorian give his commencement speech, but he didn't mind. This was the fifth graduation he'd been tasked with protecting since he joined the Technocrats' Guard; he was more interested in watching the crowd.

The plaza, surrounded on three sides by the looming red brick of the Academy walls, was filled with an even mix of teachers and recruiters. The Academy's educational staff wore antiquated suits in bland colors; gray, brown, navy. By contrast, the corporate types showed off the latest fashions, every thread an organic microcircuit capable of displaying any of the thousands of colors the human eye could detect. Most had configured their outfits to display slogans suitable for the workday; becoming walking advertisements for signing bonuses and "great corporate culture."

Code for *work for us, because we literally can't afford to treat you like dirt.* 

Demetrius tried not to envy the psy-tagged GeneEs for being presented with choices. Peacekeepers like him didn't get commencement speeches. They were born into fifteen years of a brutally calibrated training regimen before being sent to stand guard over the GeneEs who actually contributed something to society, instead of merely defending its status quo. 

Looked at through the lens of objectivity, the status quo sucked.

One woman caught his eye, unusual enough to jolt him from the familiar ground of old resentments. In a sea of men and women with close-cropped hair and professional updos, she wore her hair long and loose. Her bright yellow sundress looked handmade, its simple patterns crafted with a skill few bothered to develop. Was it knit? Woven? He didn't know, but wanted to ask.

If she knew she was out of place here, she didn't show it. Her eyes were focused intently on the speaker, pride beaming from every millimeter curve of her bottom-heavy lips. They were too pink to be their natural color, a color he suddenly wanted to know. His own lips curved in unconscious echo of her unfettered joy as he noticed the faint hint of tears glistening in her eyes.

When was the last time he had seen someone that happy? Had he ever? 

"Who *is* she?" He didn't realize he'd spoken aloud until Tactical answered; the telepath was better than most about only responding to verbals.

The mic in his ear went live with an almost inaudible *pop.* **::Not one of ours. Farseer is running her tags now... Meghana Davies. Looks like she's here on a valedictorian ticket, here we go: her brother is Connor Davies, a clairvoyant GeneE.::**

"That's odd," Demetrius mused. GeneEs didn't usually have normie relatives, especially not close ones.

**::Keep sharp,::** Tactical sent, his bio-transmitter rendering the message in artificial tones. Some tech had calibrated the computer voice so it didn't edge too far into uncanny valley, but they'd only mostly succeeded. Born both deaf and mute, telepaths sounded weird no matter what program rendered their words. **::I'm not the only telepath picking up some weird vibes.::** 

Demetrius abandoned the scope and started scanning with his naked eye, looking for the telltale signs of disturbance; sudden movement, odd gaps. A skinny man moving toward the bathroom; dismissed. Teenage boy kneeling down to play with an infant; dismissed. A glint of light.

He lowered his eye to the scope, identified the flash: a knife. Held to the sun-kissed throat of a woman in a simple yellow dress. 

Demetrius sucked in a deep breath, steadied his core as he let it out. Flexed his fingers once. *Sorry, pretty lady,* he thought, knowing he didn't dare risk aiming for anything less gory than a headshot, not the way the guy was standing, his body mostly-hidden behind his hostage.

He adjusted his aim a little to the right, grateful to the Academy walls for blocking the wind. There wasn’t time for careful adjustments, and he didn't dare miss. Not firing into a crowd like this. 

*Am I authorized?* he asked Tactical. 

Saw forearm tendons bulge. 

Took the shot.

Knew he'd have to justify the decision in triplicate later, didn't care about anything except how the body dropped. 

Dead. 

*Ops shouldn't have put me up here if they didn't want me making the call.*

They knew how he'd been trained. The technocracy had molded him into a remorseless killing machine since the moment his geneticists started building his genome. How could his superiors be surprised when he didn't regret the decision to save the life of an innocent woman? 

She was pale. Bits of brain and bone stained her dress like a bloody caricature of dawn, and her hands shook as she pushed up her hair so its dampness wouldn't cling to her neck. He'd bet his next round of hazard pay that she'd break down later, when the shock wore off, but for now she hadn't processed the corpse crumpled on the ground beside her. Before she could, Colonel Sumner had reached her side, abandoning his post at the steps of the stage to a subordinate. 

Demetrius felt a spike of jealousy. He'd been the one to save her, but it would be Sumner she thanked. He might not have cared, except the Colonel was a egomaniacal jerk. Most of the infantry guys were, their testosterone levels spiked up so high that it took rigid protocols, embedded since birth, to keep them from cutting a violent swath through polite society. Sumner was worse than most, though—took no responsibility for his blowups and once he cooled off, he held grudges so tight they squeaked. 

Ops, of course, loved him for his bulldog tenacity and slavish devotion to their rulebook. 

A rulebook Demetrius had just flagrantly ignored. 

**::Lethal force authorized at thirteen forty-two hours,::** Tactical said, and in surprise, Demetrius flicked his gaze down at the chronometer embedded in his wrist. 13:43:06. 

Tactical was covering for him. He should have felt grateful, but instead, irritation—irrational, fueled by the adrenaline of taking a life—spiked. He could clean up his own messes. Didn't want to be responsible for anyone else's punishment if they were caught manipulating records. 

There were very few ways for a GeneE to get himself terminated from duty. They represented an enormous investment of time and resources. But even decades after the clashes of the Green Rebellion, nobody was taking any chances on Peacekeepers going rogue. 

Sumner guarded Meghana and her assailant while the rest of the Peacekeepers initiated a lockdown. Clairvoyants flagged and tagged ID chips while the telepaths confirmed identities. The only person out of place was Meghana, with her valedictorian ticket. 

**::The brother sends his thanks,::** Tactical relayed, breaking protocol even further.

He'd picked up on Demetrius' interest, then—no surprise there. Academy trained telepaths were generally pretty good about respecting at least the appearance of privacy, but the relationship between soldier and spy always tightened after things got tense.  

They'd never met, but they were a unit, whether Ops approved or not. 

Hopefully Ops had bigger problems. He didn't want to have to break in a new tactical support agent. 

"Any word on what that was about? Who was he?"

**::Techs are tearing apart the trail now, but word is it's muddy. Hard to tell if he's acting alone or if we should expect a follow-up.::**

"How'd he get a knife through security?"

**::Not sure. Sumner is furious.:: **

Demetrius snorted. "One of his people dropped the ball. You know how he hates to look bad."

*Pop.* The mic went dead before Tactical could respond. 

## 2. Target [M]

Meghana sat in the front row at her brother's graduation. His valedictorian speech should have been the proudest moment of Meghana's adult life. Instead, she was terrified.

One minute, a man had an arm wrapped around her chest, a knife at her throat, and the next, he was falling back, away, blood spraying everywhere. She didn't even hear the *crack* of the rifle until her attacker started crumpling to the ground.

She froze, arms held rigid away from her body. Horror painted the lines of her muscles in rigid detail. She didn't move until a piece of viscera—of *brain*—slid from her hair down the back of her dress.

Then, she whimpered, an animal sound of distress from deep in the back of her throat. Her whole body writhed, almost of its own volition, and she shook out her hair, violently. Choking on a sob, she wrapped the whole dark mass into a ball and looked around, desperately, for water. Anything to get it (she didn't want to confront what *it* was) off of her. A fountain, a pool. A sink. 

Instead, she saw a man, enormous, muscles bulging everywhere, sprinting toward her, faster than she could have imagined possible. Meghana recoiled, stumbling back, before she realized he was wearing a Peacekeeper's uniform. A high-ranking one, too, with two silver chevrons flashing on his sleeve as he moved. The audience parted into an aisle before him, as basic a globalist habit as standing for the planetary anthem.

*Always be ready to make an exit.* It was practically the technocracy's slogan.

A hysterical giggle her escaped as the Peacekeeper skidded to his knees beside her, the full force of his incredible speed impressive in motion but incongruously awkward when he needed to stop. The crown of his head lined up even with her belly and she found herself staring down at the perfect wave of his golden blond hair.

The static boom of a dropped microphone blasted through the air her brother noticed her at the center of the disruption.

At least, that's what she hoped.

The crowd just gawked at first, curious but too confused to be frightened. Then, the Peacekeeper claimed the bloody knife from the corpse and patted it down with quick, efficient motions.

Someone screamed when he flipped the body.

She realized it was her.

The back of the head was a gaping hole. Skull fragments were attached to the head by flaps of torn skin. A spray of blood and splattered brain decorated the ground like macabre paint.

The smell hit her, hot and coppery. Gorge rose in her throat.

Of course the Peacekeeper didn't ask if she was okay, or offer a handkerchief for the blood dripping down her neck.

Was it hers? She couldn't be sure, would have to check. Would have to be tested, before she could return to the preserve. The border guards were fierce in their protection; she still preferred not to think about the how thoroughly they'd searched her before allowing her through the gates that segregated the reserve from the rest of the globe, and that had been when she *left.*

"Please walk, do not run, to the archway. Peacekeepers are waiting to show you to a secure room designated for your debriefing." Another Peacekeeper must have taken the microphone from Connor. 

As a preservist, it shouldn't have made her feel safer that the Peacekeepers had taken control of the situation, but it did—until Chevrons stood, empty-handed, banked fury in his eyes as they met hers with the full force of the Technocracy's authority. "Interview. 13:43:10. Do you have any enemies, Ms. Davies?"

Of course he knew her name. There was no privacy here, outside the preserve. She wouldn't have been here, in this "civilized" world of computer lenses and mobile implants, if it hadn't been for her mother insisting she learn to know her family. Family was important, on the preserve, even when your family didn't live in the preserve—didn't share your values.

Even when family was GeneE. Connor was her half-brother, but he was still family.

Clinging to that fact, her eyes flashed to the stage. She was desperate to find her brother, but he had been shuffled off into the crowd.

He would be so worried. Wouldn't he? She needed to find him.

If this damn Peacekeeper would let her.

"Ms. Davies?" he prompted, jerking her attention back to his face. It was a nice face. Distinctive, with its cleft chin and sharp cheekbones. "Ma'am, do you have any enemies?"

He'd asked that already, hadn't he?

Better answer, before someone started to worry about shock. She was in shock. The last thing she needed was to wind up in a technocrat's hospital, getting prodded and labeled and sorted into neat little files. "There are some people back home who don't like that I'm here, supporting Connor. His ... enhancements aren't exactly popular where I'm from." For that matter, neither were the guards'. The whole point of the preserves was to safeguard the lifestyles that had been threatened by the genetic engineering and the other 'wonders' of the Information Age. 

Well. Most of the point. A pretty solid chunk of the people who had petitioned to live in the preserve were paranoid privacy fanatics; she hadn't counted herself among them, until now. Until she realized what it would mean to have her medical records integrated into the technocracy's databases. To have people crawling through her family history. Cataloguing her natural-born skills, pushing her toward her 'potential.' 

She shuddered. 

He lunged at her. It was so unexpected that she jerked backwards, but it didn't matter. He swept her up faster than she could even think about getting away, forcing all the breath from her belly with the blow.

Carrying her over his shoulder like a sack of summer squash, he ran through the slow-moving crowd toward the Academy's arch. She might have screamed if she'd had the breath. Might have struggled if she'd had the presence of mind.

*With guards like you, who needs enemies?* she wanted to snap as she tried to hold on, be more than dead weight. It wasn't the first time she'd had such a seditious thought, and out here in the big, wide, globally-interconnected world, she feared it had been a dangerous one.

The technocrats always insisted that there weren't any Thought Police, but nobody believed that. Of course, the technocrats had profiles of internet users that revealed more about a person than any cursory mental drop-in performed by a telepathic scanner. The GeneEs weren't why she hated to leave the preserve.

Not that she'd been expecting someone to try and take her hostage. A good reason to stay home if she'd ever heard one.

If that's what it had been.

He set her down roughly, in the shadow of the arch, but didn't go past the guards who were still funneling people inside. Though he put his body between hers and the crowd, his attention wasn't on her anymore. 

That, more than anything, frightened her. Peacekeepers were known for nothing if not their tenacity, and he definitely had not finished questioning her.

"What's happening?" she asked, not really expecting an answer.

"I don't know." Terse, angry, but the honesty of it shocked her most. She was used to Peacekeepers treating her like an cog—slightly bent and always inconvenient, but a mere cog nonetheless. "The comms are out."

The technocracy had *telepaths.* How could their comms be out?

**::Rebels have hacked the code for our military-grade synthesizers. Please inform Colonel Sumner that the technocracy is compromised.::**

"Compromised?" she blurted. How was that even possible? The government didn't just control the hackers, it *was* the hackers. In a technocracy ruled almost entirely by algorithms, engineers and developers were the kings and priests of their era. 

The fullness of Sumner's attention snapped back to her. "Do you know something?" he demanded.

She shook her head, sharply, more for clarity than denial. "Someone—in my head—"

**::You have diplomatic implants. Your father didn't tell you? Wow. No wonder**— **it doesn't matter now. Please. The rebels. Tell him Tactical says he needs to know.::**

"Rebels?" There were rebels? How could there be rebels? The technocrats controlled *everything.* 

Except, apparently—"Tactical says your synthesizers have been hacked." The words felt strange in her mouth. Foreign. It shouldn't have been possible. 

Sumner cursed, grabbed her by the wrist and jerked her toward the dubious safety of an increasingly crowded building.

"Stick close," he said. "You might still be a target." 

## 3. Liability [D]

Protocol dictated that Demetrius remain at his post and rely on the engineers to fix any technical errors interfering with his duties—or, in lieu of a technical solution, wait for word from the ranking officer.

Demetrius was a trained sniper. He could be very patient when the situation called for it. Otherwise, he liked to be decisive.

Protocol was for people who couldn't see the bigger picture, who abdicated their decision-making to algorithms and rulebooks instead of daring to think beyond themselves. It was for people who couldn't think quickly enough in an emergency and needed a fallback.

Demetrius was smart enough to know that there was no point in waiting for Sumner to remember to loop him in. Without orders or someone from tactical to relay targeting data, he was useless here.

Of course, if comms came back online and he wasn't where orders had put him, he'd be worse than useless: he'd become a liability.

Demetrius looked through the scope and evaluated his options. Sumner was out of sight, and the woman with him, but there were still Peacekeepers visible, directing and guarding the crowd. One stood alone, centered in the entrance to the plaza, as if his muscled bulk could fill it with sheer willpower. The lone chevron on his shoulder marked him as a major, and therefore probably the second-ranking Peacekeeper in Eurasia. Demetrius knew the man by reputation; Miro was the battalion's executive officer and had built a reputation more for diligence than ingenuity.

Demetrius watched as Miro slid his communicator out of his ear and ran his fingers over it, frowning as he tried and failed to detect signs of functionality.

Giving up, the Major slowly flapped his arms up and down, like a slow-motion bird. Though Demetrius recognized the semaphore signal for *attention / error,* he wasn't sure he'd ever seen semaphore used outside of training. Like sign language, the military taught it for redundancy but for day-to-day life, it had been made obsolete by translator applications and contact lens captioning.

Clear enough evidence, then, that comms being down wasn't an isolated issue.

After a moment, the Major must have received acknowledgment, because he started signaling: N O *space* C O M M || *ready to receive* || *acknowledged*.

Damn. He wished he'd been looking at the other guard; the Major must have gotten orders, but what? Remain in place, probably, but—

It wasn't Demetrius' problem. For now, there was nothing he could do but watch and wait, so he stood up from his sniper's sprawl and took a small pair of field binoculars from the pocket of his superflex slacks so he could survey the area.

His perch loomed above the rest of the Academy walls, letting him peer out over the surrounding city to the west. It was the only direction worth looking, as the Rhône River wound its way into Lake Geneva along the south and east. The Academy itself stretched northward beyond the plaza, where the informal headquarters for the world's GeneE population filled in the whole peninsula. At dusk, his view would have been even more limited, but for now, the sun remained helpfully overhead instead of shining in his eyes.

Other than the Academy, the historic district had few buildings taller than three floors. It sat nestled in the bosom of the bustling metropolis, thousands of years of history bottled up inside sky-scraping marvels of glass and steel, each with hundreds of floors. The posh apartments and engineering offices inside enjoyed the protection offered by such close proximity to the Academy's professors and guards. An enormous billboard, its pixels formed by the energy-efficient honeycomb of programmable glass that windowed the lower offices, flickered through displays advertising the latest cola recipe and hottest trends in hat accessories–or, they did normally.

Now, it displayed a single, unchanging message: IS THIS UTOPIA?

Similar market displays had been pioneered in Times Square, before Manhattan was lost beneath the Hudson River despite the billions spent to save it. That message had no business being on that screen for that long; the sheer cost would beggar anyone but the richest of the technocrats. 

The technocracy ran on sensors and decision trees. It hadn’t tolerated malfunctions in decades. Gremlins and code bugs had been reduced to the mythos of a bygone era. 

He had to tell Sumner.

The computer skill necessary to bypass the protections placed on advertisement databases existed only in the most skilled of the engineers; that semi-mythical percentage of computer engineers who were capable not only of diligent application of mathematical principles but also the innovations necessary to exploit them.

But if a technocrat was responsible, *why hadn't the Peacekeepers been warned?* 

It didn't make sense. Peacekeepers got looped in on anything and everything that might cause a disruption. If the government was declaring societal perfection, there should have been Peacekeepers on duty to deal with the celebrations. 

If the government *hadn't* made this declaration, it could mean nothing but trouble–trouble too big for Demetrius to shoot. 

There was no use waving his hands around up here; no one was looking his way, and the message he had to convey was far too complex for semaphore.

With practiced, expert motions, Demetrius broke down his rifle and packed it into its case. Slim, brown, and square, it would have been right at home in the hands of a broker, banker or lawyer, protecting a secure computer or even one of the antiquated notebooks some of the truly paranoid insisted upon. 

After all, it wasn't just protective details the government used him for. Everyone was more comfortable when they could pretend he didn't exist. The briefcase offered enough camouflage to make that easier.

The design was apparently also great for concealing bombs, but there hadn't been a credible bomb scare since the government put everything on the blockchain. It was harder to get away with making thermite when a planet full of computers were devoted to tracking purchases of magnesium strips and detonator switches.

In these big-data days of psychic surveillance and learnéd machine trackers, most crimes were the product of impulse, and consequences came quick.

The exception was the preserves, though each one was different.

He'd heard that the farmers in the mid-east regions of North America were nice. The natives in the Amazon Basin and along Baja California never gave anyone any trouble; at least, he'd never had occasion to visit.

By contrast, he'd crossed the Congo River five times in the last three years, and gone once to the Scottish Highlands to put down a bloody civil war.

Officially, the technocracy maintained a hands-off approach to the preserves.

On a practical level, the preserves existed to maintain access to ancient skills and memorialize cultures that had intangible value but could not compete economically with the technocracy's advances. There was no value in allowing them to burn, and the government cared deeply about value.

*Somebody* had a plan. He didn’t think it was the government. 

Demetrius had one too, and it didn't involve weaving through the maze of a building beneath him. 

He slung his gun case onto his back by its shoulder strap and  pulled a pair of knife-fighting gloves from a small pouch on his utility harness. Not that he intended to do any knife fighting; the material was multi-purpose and would protect his hands from the the nylon rope he’d secured to the steel grating of the parapet. He threaded it through the carabiner looped onto the front loop of his utility harness was the work of seconds, then jumped over the edge. 

Rappelling down the side of the bell tower wasn’t the safest way to get to the ground–too exposed, if nothing else–but it was the fastest, and Demetrius had climbed a lot of cliffs in his time as the Technocracy’s most effective sniper.  

The wind whipped around him as he let the rope lower him down, the bottoms of his feet barely touching the wall as he fell. He slowed only enough to keep from jarring his knees as he landed, sparing a moment of thanks for the genetic engineers who had insisted on the extra padding he and the other GeneEs got in their joints.

Demetrius released the rope and the auto-belay mechanism pulled it back up as it sensed the lack of weight. He hoped it would be another five years before he needed it; or rather, he hoped he'd ever have a reason to use it again.

“Where did you come from?” 

Demetrius smiled and flashed his ident badge. “Did you know that the word *belfry* comes from the German words meaning ‘to protect peace?’” 

The Peacekeeper stared at him, uncomprehending.

With a pleasant smile, Demetrius raised a finger toward the sky, but didn't wait for the young Peacekeeper to figure it out. He'd draw the right conclusions in a second or two.

GeneEs were bred for intelligence, but critical thinking took a different kind of training than the street-level Peacekeepers received.

Demetrius hoped the colonel could assemble clues a little more efficiently.

A knife on Academy grounds. Peacekeeper comms offline. A billboard questioning utopia.

He hoped Sumner had a plan.

Hoped Sumner wasn’t in on the plot, because Demetrius could think of only one explanation: rebels. 


## 4. Seer [C]

Connor didn’t resist the Peacekeepers’ efforts to herd the crowd of GeneE psychics and state-sanctioned recruiters into the dubious safety of the Academy. It would be futile; he was familiar with the practiced efficiency the Technocracy expected of all their agents. 

The press of bodies was crushingly tight despite everyone’s best efforts, but Connor was more worried about his sister than his discomfort. Most people probably didn't even know why the evacuation had been ordered, but Connor had been on stage. He'd watched a lunatic grab his sister and been helpless to save her. He'd witnessed the attacker’s death and felt only sick satisfaction in response to witnessing his first shooting. It wasn't how a medical professional was supposed to feel in the face of a lost life, and maybe later that would bother him, but in the moment he had only been relieved.

Until the cold mask of crisis-management slid over the Peacekeeper Colonel’s face when he went to investigate. 

Trapped in a phalanx of bodies too prestigious to push through, there was nothing Connor could to help his sister navigate the Technocracy’s justice system. Would she know how important it was to answer every question thoroughly and honestly? She was from the preserves. Did they even *have* investigations there? He didn’t know. 

Connor might have dared a breach of etiquette if it weren’t for for the Peacekeeper on guard. Not for the first time that day, he cursed his status as valedictorian. No one would care if he slipped through the crowd as a regular graduate. 

Once the cluster of dignitaries got through the archway and into the Academy proper, the Director turned to one of the alumni speakers. "I thought General McGree was just being paranoid when he insisted on assigning a sniper to the guard detail.”

Connor tried to ignore the chatter, standing on his tiptoes to check the passing rooms for the yellow flash of a homespun sundress. In a just universe, his clairvoyance would have helped, but even if he hadn't specialized in fine-grain detail work, clairvoyance worked best on the micro and macro levels. Detecting cells about to turn cancerous was an order of magnitude easier than finding one person in a mob of people packed in like sardines. The Academy's thick maze of stone walls didn't help.

"Another protester? I thought we'd put an end to that luddite nonsense during the Green Revolution." 

"Amazing how some people are willing to die to say we shouldn't exist, don't you think?"

The director snorted delicately. "Counterproductive, at least."

"I'm more worried about how they snuck a knife into the plaza. I thought the Peacekeepers were here to stop that sort of thing."

The Peacekeeper probably thought so too, judging from the stiffness in his tone. "In here, please," and gestured inside a classroom off to Connor's left. 

Connor recognized the chemistry lab and had no intention of cooling his heels until the Peacekeepers got around to confirming his safety—a process that would doubtless occur well after the other dignitaries in the room were sent on their way.

If he went in there, it would be hours before they let him out.

"I need to find my sister. She was attacked."

The Peacekeeper blinked; it was more of a reaction than Connor had expected. "I'm sorry, but–"

"That was your sister?" the director asked, surprise lilting her voice. GeneEs didn't usually have unmodified siblings, and Meghana couldn't have looked more like a UMO if she'd tried. Even her clothes were organic, and if Connor didn't know their father, he wouldn't have believed they were related, either.

Connor nodded.

"You can at least tell him if she's okay," the director said kindly, laying a supportive hand on Connor's shoulder as she offered the compromise.

Now the Peacekeeper looked uncomfortable, half-frozen with an indecision so strange that Connor's fretting became full-blown fear. Something was wrong, and the Peacekeeper knew, and he didn't want to share.

The director realized it before Connor could figure out how to demand information from a Peacekeeper. Authority framed her like an icy mantle as she drew herself up, no longer content to be led along for safety's sake. "Tell me."

The Peacekeeper swallowed and lowered his voice. "Only because you're the Academy Director. We can't afford a panic."

The director nodded, but kept a tight grip on Connor's shoulder. Just as well; Connor wasn't sure he could have made himself leave, if the Peacekeeper insisted. Not when his sister's life could be at stake.

"Our comms are out. I don't know where the colonel is."

The director stiffened. "And it didn't occur to you to ask one of us to find out?"

The Peacekeeper refused to wilt under the director's incredulity. "Sir, I have my orders. I'm to keep you safe and locked down until we can determine—"

Closing her eyes in what Connor assumed was a bid for patience, the director turned her back on the Peacekeeper and snapped her fingers at Connor. "Who's the best telepath in your class?"

"Ma'am?" It wasn't the question he'd expected to be asked. "Um, it depends on how you–" he shook himself; debates over range vs. accuracy didn't matter now. "For what you're thinking, you want Dee."

The Director fixed the Peacekeeper with a flat stare. "Then let's go find Dee."

Someone—male—walked toward them from the archway, which didn't make sense; Connor's group had been last in and farthest back. In the hallway, the man was far enough away from the mass of people and furniture that Connor's clairvoyance could make out details, and *holy shit*, "That man has a gun." It was in pieces, but he had a gun and if the Peacekeepers didn't know—

The Peacekeeper reached for his sidearm. Adrenaline slammed into Connor's system and he whirled toward the door just as the man, tall and dark, walked into the lab.

"Director?" the man said. He totally ignored the gun pointed at him. To the unmodified eye, he looked like a businessman except for the strange black belt at his waist. "Come with me."

With his 'DAR mods, Connor could detect the subtle signs of genetic engineering—extra valves in the veins of his legs, thicker bone, extra cartilage around the knee. They were the kinds of modifications the technocracy kept out of hands of the general population, who were limited toward more the mainstream optimizations that could plausibly appear in the general population naturally. Tweaks to eliminate Alzheimer's were one thing, but this man had a full suite of hidden mods. 

Lacking clairvoyance, the Peacekeeper cocked his weapon. "The director isn't going anywhere. Identify yourself!"

The man snorted. "Put your gun away, I outrank you."

Who *was* he? Another Peacekeeper? But their mods were *really* different.

Whoever he was, the director wasted no time in stepping around her erstwhile guardian. "It’s fine, Constable. Mr. Zayt is on your team. Though what he needs me for, I’ve no idea."

"I need to get to the Colonel and I need your access key to do it. Let's go." Zayt turned, trusting the director to obey.

"Wait," Connor blurted.

Zayt paused, cocking his head to the side, but he didn't turn.

"Sumner has my sister," he pushed out the words in a rush. "Can I–"

The director took him by the elbow as Zayt waved him on.

In the hallway, Connor and the director fell in a half-step behind Zayt on either side, flanking him.

"We’re going to visit Tele-command. If Sumner doesn't still have Meghana, he'll at least know where she is."

"What do you mean 'Tele-command?'" the director demanded as they passed an empty physics classroom. A scale model of a swing set stood surrounded by the small blue chairs someone said were meant to be ergonomic. "Why do you need my access key—"

"The Academy is a secure location with a lot of telepathic activity to act as cover, and everyone who goes into the program is familiar with the city. Where else would they put a command center?"

*On a remote island?* Connor thought. *A gated community? A military base?* He was too afraid to say the words out loud—what if Zayt sent him back to the Peacekeepers?

"Is this why McGree insisted on bringing you in for the graduation?"

"I doubt it; I'm pretty sure HQ has been here since before they built the Academy."

"Why wasn't I told?" the director demanded.

"Director, now is not the time to complain about the technocracy's secrets. I'm sure you've kept a few yourself. Come on." Zayt picked up his pace.

Despite his genetic advantages over UMOs, Connor struggled to keep up. Genetics only got a GeneE so far, and clairvoyants weren’t conditioned for speed. He was the Academy's valedictorian, not its star sprinter.

The director didn't help his pride, either—she had decades on Connor and was barely breathing hard.

As they turned a corner toward the dorms, Zayt paused and looked at Connor. "You're welcome, by the way."

Connor blinked. "For what?"

"Saving your sister." 

## 5. Harbinger [D]

Meghana filled the space around her with a simple steadiness that hadn't been captured by his lens, and Demetrius couldn't help but pause to appreciate the way relief relaxed the tension in her body as her brother rushed to where she was seated. She was even more striking in person. Her hair, clean now, fell like a dark curtain around them as they embraced, and Demetrius wished, fiercely, he could be a part of their moment. 

He'd always thought GeneEs—mostly conceived in labs for state-sponsored surrogates—didn't have relationships with their families, weren't close to anyone but their coworkers and brothers-in-arms. Who else could empathize with the challenges of their role? Understand their lives? 

He'd thought he'd come to terms with the nature of his role pulling him away from those connections, thought he'd adjusted to a solitary life of duty, but now, watching Connor ask after his sister?

He hadn't felt this lonely since leaving the crèche.

The two Peacekeepers stationed inside were doubtless annoyed they hadn't been able to shoot him, and they were the closest colleagues he had. 

Setting the emotion aside, Demetrius turned away from the reunion and confronted Sumner's thunderous expression. Half a mile underground in a room full of telepaths, the colonel felt no need to hide his ire behind a polite façade.

"Why aren't you at your post?" Sumner snapped.

It took all of Demetrius' professionalism to keep from snapping back. While yes, Sumner outranked him, they operated under different chains of command. Demetrius let that fact settle his mood. "The comms are down and I needed to get a message to you." Each word sounded calm and reasonable. 

"Clearly you knew I would be able to work around that problem, or you wouldn't have come down to tele-command—" There was a pregnant pause. "—with a civilian."

Demetrius' cheek twitched before he controlled the impulse to clench his jaw. Maybe he’d been operating on detached duty for too long. "His sister was attacked and as *I'm sure you already know,* we have bigger problems than maintaining OpSec from people on our own side."

Sumner's expression didn't soften. If anything, his glare deepened. "OpSec is exactly what I'm concerned about. There should have been no way for luddites to sneak weapons into the plaza, much less hack military-grade comms. I can understand wanting to trust our own, but—"

Sumner hated being interrupted. Demetrius lost patience and did it anyway. "Sir, I agree." Let *that* surprise him. "This is not a luddite upswing. Billboards and synthesizers have been *hacked*; luddites don’t have the tech for that. Whatever's happening, it's high-level and it's bigger than the propaganda-fodder of disrupting graduation."

Whatever their history, it wasn't enough to make Sumner forget his duty. The man was an asshole but he wasn't a fool. "You think the attack was a feint? A man *died.*"

"Yes, sir, I do. I also think that the kid is no more likely to be involved in this than his sister, or you would have already arrested her. This isn't about her."

Sumner's mouth turned down in a disapproving frown. "You had no way of knowing—"

Sometimes the pure-bred lines lacked a certain independence of thought, necessary in situations like this. "Sir, does it matter?"

Sumner huffed an annoyed breath and pivoted to face the group of telepaths arrayed in a horseshoe busily monitoring a bank of monitors. Demetrius cringed internally at the idea of being forced to sit with his back to an entrance, but the telepaths had no reason not to trust the guard stationed in the center of the room. 

The Technocracy fostered specialization and besides, the telepaths had bigger things to worry about than a technocracy sniper with two civilians in tow. The synthesizer hack had rendered them mute, and the frustration in the room was palpable as they methodically skimmed through old video feeds looking for clues.  

"Somebody bring up the feed in the market square," Sumner ordered. Under his breath, he added, "Unless someone hacked that too."

The big screen behind the guard station transitioned from a display of the empty plaza to the market square Demetrius had identified. *Is this Utopia?*

Sumner grunted deep in the back of his throat at the confirmation that Demetrius' report was correct.

"Belay the audience scans," he said. "The attack was a feint. Somebody find out how far this goes."

Several of the nearby telepaths frowned, frustration making a grimace of their faces, but though agitation made them hesitate as a group, all but one complied.

The remaining telepath started signing furiously. He was a thick, solid man, dark-haired and cleft-chinned, his fingers blunt but dexterous. "Without the synthesizers, we're having trouble reaching Ops. This facility was built to be off-grid." He *looked* like a leader, and cynically, Demetrius wondered whether he'd been chosen to speak for the security crew because of ability or—more likely—his appearance. 

Sumner was cut from the same pale, dark-haired trope, but despite the requirements of his rank, must not have kept up with TSL. One of the guards, her hair pulled back in a bun so tight it made Demetrius' head ache in sympathy, interpreted for him.

The synthesizer hack wasn't localized, then. Demetrius wasn't surprised. Concerned; not surprised.

"I didn't ask about Ops," Sumner snapped at the guard.

Demetrius winced at the breach of etiquette and directed a question at the telepath. "What's your range, with the relays out?"

"Approximately 6 kilometers," the telepath signed. "Others here can reach up to 10."

"Can you detect anyone reacting to anything else that's odd?"

The telepath snorted, a sound Demetrius hadn't thought would be odd but lacked even the inarticulate grunt vocal chords could make. He’d forgotten that telepath genekit rearranged the throat and neck to allow room for brainwave receptors.

A wry smile and a flicker of—not shame, but close—told Demetrius that the telepath had heard his thought.

*Sorry.*

The telepath waved a dismissive hand and signed, "Geneva is a low-density city. There aren't many other—Wait." His eyes went distant as he concentrated on too many things at once. "Flying object, coming in low."

Everyone turned to Connor, the only clairvoyant in the room. 

"I can't sense anything this deep underground," Connor said defensively. "That's the whole point of—"

"Maybe someone came to investigate the anomaly?" Meghana suggested hesitantly. Like she felt obligated to interject optimism into a room readying for war.

Sumner ignored her, rounding on Demetrius. "You should never have—"

If he was still on the tower, he could be feeding information to the command center. But if he was still on the tower, the telepaths would never have looked beyond the Academy for information. Unless it was the clairvoyants who were sensing the intrusion.

"We need to get up top," Demetrius said, rather than debate the point.

"No time!" Sumner scowled as he fought to make a decision.

Demetrius reined in his frustration. The guard saved him from having to respond. "Orders, sir?"

The telepaths didn't wait for orders.

"No one sensed inside. The senior Davies is a diplomat. He could be blocking—"

One of the small screens to the left flickered back the plaza. They watched in silence as a stealth 'copter whipped the grass with the force of its landing. No wonder the clairvoyants hadn't sensed it until it was too late; its lines *screamed* 'reduced radar profile' and though the displays were silent, Demetrius would have bet his rifle that its blades had barely any acoustic signature.

Adrenaline pounded through Demetrius' system as he studied the unfamiliar logo on the fuselage.

"Orders, sir?" The guard sounded tense; she'd noticed too. The telepaths ignored the tension as they worked to uncover more data, but the Davies' knuckles were white.

"Shut up," Sumner snapped. "I'm thinking."

Demetrius didn't have time to wait for Sumner to finish thinking. He turned to face the Director, who wore the bland expression of a woman past the point of shock. "What is the Academy's exit strategy?"

The director didn't take her eyes off the screen. "Though the plaza to the lake, then north to the mountains." The words sounded distant, detached. Unenhanced or not, she hadn't risen to her position through stupidity; if Sumner ordered an evacuation, they weren't going through the plaza. 

She was offering an answer, not a solution.

Demetrius forced his voice to remain even. "And the backup plan?" There was always a backup plan.

The director's smile was wry and just a little bit bitter as she finally met Demetrius' gaze. "I'm probably not who you should be asking, Mr. Zayt. My title appears to be honorary." 

## 6. Translator [M]

Meghana had never seen a telepath before. She was doing her best not to fixate on the strangeness of his oblong throat. She'd been even more disturbed by the bulbous hump surrounding his brainstem, until he'd explained over her synthesizer (which still freaked her out) that it was where his telepathic receptors hooked into his nervous system.

Apparently, her brother the clairvoyant had far more subtle receptors embedded in his skull, but they weren't doing him much good, despite his best efforts to figure out what was going on up above. 'DAR was more limited than clairvoyance, as it seemed Connor's genekit hadn't been designed to penetrate 15 metres of rock and clay—that was the whole point of burying tele-command under the Academy.

It was nice of the telepath—he said his name was Bromden Neue—to try to make her feel more settled by filling in the blanks for her. It was intimidating to sit here, not just because she was a UMO surrounded by GeneEs, but also because of their exalted rank.

This wasn't like when she'd visited Connor last summer and he'd taken her out drinking with his friends—she'd been a fish out of water there, but it hadn't been that much weirder than any other time she'd tried to fit in with a group used to different hobbies, different interests, different jobs. She'd felt much the same back home when she left the archives to interview some of the local loggers about the mahogany blight.

This was different. More like when she was a kid and she'd gone to northern Appalachia with her father, tagging along when he'd gotten sent out to solve a border crisis with the preservist enclave there. Then, as now, she'd been out of place, surrounded by people with *authority* and expected to make herself as small and quiet as possible.

Meghana took her cue from Colonel Sumner and watched the plaza feed, rubbing the hem of her borrowed shirt as she sat waiting for something to happen.

After about a minute, the hatch of the stealth 'copter opened, a ramp dropped, and a squat robot trundled down it. It was about five feet tall and looked like a mechanical centaur, with tank treads in lieu of a horse's body and camera ports where a human head might go, situated above guns and rocket launchers. A rounded blade protruded from its metaphorical chest.

Meghana's horrified gasp was drowned out by curses. Military robots had been outlawed for over two hundred years; she'd only seen them in historical records about the Green Rebellion. For fifty bloody and brutal years, the technocrats fought to get the environment under control, and they’d used robots to do it. 

They had no discretion, weren't flexible enough to differentiate reliably between appropriate times to *capture* versus *kill.* Even people who were uncomfortable with Technocrats’ Guard and their genekits agreed that the utter inhumanity of robots was worse.

"Initiate defense protocols," Sumner said in a flat voice. 

A second robot, then a third, trundled out as Bromden turned away. Seconds later, heavy doors of ceramic and steel emerged from thick walls of decorative stone to cover doors and windows displayed on the surveillance feeds.

"Defense protocols?" The director sounded outraged. 

"They're ancient, Director Alten" Zayt explained with exaggerated patience. "They were installed back when rioters were still trying to murder any GeneEs they could get their hands on." He was a dark man, smaller than the other Peacekeepers but it was hard to remember that when she wasn't looking directly at him. He had a presence, a *decisiveness* that reminded her, strangely enough, of her hometown mechanic. 

Johnnie had an intensity, a passion for doing things the *right* way, not the easy way, that made him seem bigger than he really was. He'd even stood up to her mother a time or two, before she died, when Meghana had wanted to know how combustion worked and her mom thought engineering was a waste of time for a girl already well on her way to becoming an archivist.

Zayt didn't seem like the type to back down, either. Not even in the face of deathbots.

They lined up in front of the plaza stage and one by one launched a rocket at the archway.

Meghana flinched. 

Confused and frightened, she said, "I don't understand. Why are mechs back? The nation-states fell. The Peacekeepers won. How can there be robots? Is this a joke?" 

**::Please tell the Colonel that Major Miro is unaware of the robot threat but is sensing the rocket impacts. He is familiar with the defense protocols and has begun moving civilians into the auditorium. It won't hold everyone.::**

Peacekeepers had stopped the nationalist mechs then; she had to believe they could do it now. Otherwise, she would die here.

She shivered as she realized that this couldn't be an isolated attack. The *technocracy* might die here, if the Peacekeepers couldn't stop the mechs.

That she did not live under the technocracy's direct control was not the point; she was enough her father's daughter to appreciate that the technocracy *allowed* preservists to remain on the outside of global society. Another regime might not offer that option.

**::Please. It's important that he know.::**

Shame flushed her cheeks. *Sorry.* She cleared her throat nervously. "Colonel, Tactical wants you to know that Major Miro isn't going to be able to fit all the civilians into the auditorium."

Zayt's eyes snapped to hers. "Your synthesizer still works?"

"My father is a diplomat." It was barely an explanation, but he seemed to accept it.

"We can't fit all those people down here," Sumner said. "We need to evacuate."

One of the camera feeds died in a rocket-fueled flash. 

"You aren't going to be able to evacuate," Zayt snapped. "We need to get topside, stop the robots before they breach the walls. Davies can relay information from Tactical, if it comes up; there's nothing telepaths can do about robots. We're not doing any good here."

**::There's nothing they're going to be able to do about those robots, either,::** Bromden told her. She didn't repeat the comment, but from the white rimming Sumner's eyes as he tried to find a solution that didn't involve him ordering Peacekeepers to suicide, she didn't need to.

"Tele-command isn't the only thing down here," Connor said into the tense silence.

"Opsec—"

"Fuck Opsec," Zayt snapped. He plopped his briefcase on the table and started assembling the weapon inside with angry, efficient movements. "Opsec is blown. Those are *battlemechs,* Colonel. There must be something here we can use."

"Fine. Kid, you're with me,” Sumner took a breath. “Let's go find out what we've got to work with. Zayt, what are you doing to do?"

Zayt's teeth gleamed white. "Follow orders."

Sumner snorted rudely as he started walking toward the door. "That would be an interesting change."

"I always follow orders I agree with, sir."

"Take the girl topside and help Major Miro coordinate the Peacekeeper response. Maybe we'll pull off a miracle."

Meghana jerked in surprise. "What? You want me to—"

Connor squeezed her shoulder. "You're the only one with a working synthesizer, Meg."

Zayt offered her his hand, and with a nervous glance back at Bromden, she took it.

**::Don't worry,::** Bromden told her. **::He'll protect you.::**

## 7. Specialist [D]

Demetrius was grateful to have left the director behind. It was just about the only thing about this situation he was grateful for.

Having a civilian with him made him deeply uncomfortable. He was responsible for her safety, and here he was, taking her *toward* danger.

Alone, Demetrius could have taken the stairs at a run and barely felt it. With Meghana at his side, he had to keep his pace to a fast walk. She was young and healthy, but not conditioned. By the second set of stairs, her breath was ragged – she'd never be able to keep up with him full out. Since she was his only connection to Sumner and more importantly Tactical, he didn't dare leave her behind, even if he wanted to.

Which he didn't.

He wanted to carry her. He could move faster even weighed down with her and his rifle, but he didn't want to insult her.

He needed her cooperation.

"Any updates?"

She shook her head and tried to make her breathing steady. "Bromden says the battle mechs are keeping up their bombardment."

"Bromden?"

She flushed. "Tactical."

The overhead lights in the corridor went dark. Demetrius heard Meghana's yelp before his eyes adjusted to the illumination offered when the faint orange emergency lights switched on. Knee-high and small enough to fit in Demetrius' palm, the shadows they cast distorted everything so badly he couldn't tell if the sallowness of Meghana's skin was nerves or natural.

"The mechs must have hit one of the battery banks," he said, trying to reassure her. "Don't worry. This place was built on top of a geothermal vent. All the building defenses are wired into that system. None of those rockets can touch it."

"How do you know all of this?" Meghana asked. "The director doesn't. I understand Colonel Sumner, but you aren't... Connor said you saved me, but..." she hesitated. "I can't imagine you're part of the regular security staff to he Academy, which means it makes even less sense for you to know all of this."

She was rambling, but he let her. She'd been through a lot, and it did him no harm to let her work through the logic on her own while he tried to decide how he was going to handle Miro and a pack of panicked civilians.

Finally, she said in a small voice. "You don't look like a Peacekeeper."

At that, his lips twitched into a crooked smile. "You're right; this isn't my regular duty station. I'm a specialist. I answer to Sumner, but only technically and only as part of this job. The defense information was part of my briefing."

It was a good thing, too. They finished climbing the stairs and Demetrius let her catch her breath as he tucked the duty guard's authorization chip under his tongue. It tasted coppery, but it was still better than trying to pair the director's biometrics with the exit PIN.

"It seemed like you knew each other..." she asked as they stepped through the door and started climbing the last stairwell into the main level.

Demetrius stifled the urge to laugh. "It's my fifth year on graduation duty. His second being in charge."

*Boom!* The bombardment was louder this close to the surface.

She swallowed, then offered a wan smile. "Is it always this exciting?"

He wished he could reassure her, let her know that this was all normal and under control, but he didn't think she was stupid enough for him to pull off the lie. "Honestly, it's normally very boring."

"I would have loved boring," she said, waiting as he slid the hidden panel over the underground entrance and covered it with an enormous painting of the post-flood scientist Ashlynn Ortega, who was martyred trying to save the atmosphere.

Which reminded him – "Do you have any idea why that guy went after you?"

*Boom!*

She huffed out a frustrated breath. "No, and don't think I haven't been thinking about it. I don't have any enemies, not the way you and the Colonel mean. My father, maybe, but – come on, you don't think dissidents are bombarding the entire GeneE Academy over *me,* do you?"

No. He didn't. Not really. But he'd been trained to see patterns. To analyze trends. "Your father. He's a diplomat? What's his name?"

She hesitated through another explosion then admitted, "Julian Davies."

Not just *a* diplomat: *the* diplomat. No wonder he'd been able to get his daughter fitted with an implant. No wonder he'd been able to get a GeneE engineered with his DNA as a template; Julian was the most powerful non-tech professional in the world.

Though not many knew it. 

"Wait – then how did you wind up growing up in the preserves?"

She blinked at him, then said, wryly. "The usual way. My mother–"

*Boom!*

Another thought occurred to Demetrius, and he blurted – "He isn't here, is he?"

She looked at him like he was a fool. "No, of course not. They would have told you." Of course, Julian Davies would have his own guards.

"But–"

Patiently, she explained, "Connor is GeneE; their connection is mostly one of ego. Our father signed over his parental rights before conception. But my mother and I didn't think it was right, so I tried to–"

*Preservists.* He wanted to throw up his hands and roll his eyes at their old-fashioned, outdated value system, but it would have been a lie, a mimicry of popular culture he didn't really feel.

What would it have felt like to grow up with a family who cared about him? Even at a distance? To know someone would be sad if you lived or died, not because of the value of your contribution but because of your connection?

He set aside the thought; it was too depressing to dwell on *what-if*s and they had bigger problems than his dissatisfaction with military crèches.

*Boom!* A brief pause. *Boom!* They were getting closer together.

He needed to think positive. Surely, when Julian Davies found out that both of his children were in danger, he would move heaven and earth to bring the technocracy's resources into play.

Meghana wanted the subject changed, too. Or maybe Tactical was doing him another favor. "The major has almost finished getting everyone into the cafeteria. He's got the GeneEs into a makeshift Ops center."

Critical information was missing. "Where?"

"The kitchen. There's an access door for food deliveries."

Demetrius grunted as he absorbed the information. "Any chance we can evacuate through it?"

Meghana shrugged as they hurried through the corridor.

*Boom! Boom!*

He had to get to Miro. Come up with an idea to slow it down.

"How many rockets do you think they brought?"

He grunted, unwilling to speculate. "They're close enough that they're probably using regular shells, and this place was built to stand up to mortars.” Another impact echoed through the hall and his lips twisted. “Hopefully we kept that secret better than the codes to the synthesizers." 

From the way the walls were beginning to shake, he doubted it. Modern munitions were small, but the explosions were powerful and for all the Academy's sturdy construction, it was an old building. Still, he saw no reason to worry her. There was nothing she could do. Except maybe—

"Can you run?"

She swallowed. "For a little while."

It would have to be enough.

"Follow me to the kitchens. I have an idea." 

## 8. Finder [C]

Connor had heard the golden rule of leadership described once: *often wrong, but never in doubt.* Colonel Sumner could have used the lesson. Once the decision to explore the base was made, Connor had expected a certain amount of decisiveness—and with regards to OpSec, that had been true. Sumner held nothing back as he explained all the reasons why there shouldn't have been any other rooms anywhere *near* Tele-command. Apparently, the whole point of having a secure operations center was to be self-contained and isolated. 

By contrast, Sumner had plenty of doubts about Connor's competence. "Are you sure you're not sensing barracks?" 

"Too far," Connor said shortly. He was doing his best to ignore Sumner, but it was hard to focus when the man kept demanding answers. Fortunately, Connor wasn't this year’s valedictorian of the Academy of Psychic Sciences for nothing; he was pretty good at getting the job done despite distractions. 

"We've gone through this corridor three times," Sumner said impatiently. He was right, but Connor was a little surprised he'd noticed. Maybe Peacekeeper officer training was good for something, after all. 

The hallways under the Academy were almost identical, steel beams hidden behind stone brick masonry designed to resemble an ancient catacomb; the whole place looked like it had been engineered explicitly to appear older than it was. Connor doubted that even the Peacekeepers realized how thoroughly modern the architecture was. 

"Doesn't it strike you as a little odd that a secret facility has this many blind alleys and squared off passages?

"It was designed to be defensible." Sumner's dismissive confidence set Connor's teeth on edge. "If someone stumbles in here, they wander around and get lost. More sensible than giving someone a straight-shot to the secret facility, don't you think?" 

"I think that was certainly a nice bonus.” Connor stopped walking. "This section of the wall is newer than the rest. Almost as new as the foundations at Tele-command."

Sumner frowned. "How can you tell?" 

Because that was the whole point of being clairvoyant. "Microscopic degradation in the building materials." 

Somehow he seemed surprised. "You can sense that?"

What did Sumner think clairvoyance *was?* "Your spotters can tell you that a rebel stealth drone is 20.5 meters south-by-southwest of your location instead of 22 meters. Melee specialists and espionage agents fight in three dimensional space; even genetically engineered reflexes can't sneak up on them. I trained as a doctor, Colonel. Dating cellular decay in a cloned organ is a lot more difficult than guesstimating the relative age of brick and mortar, I promise. The space behind the wall is mostly filled, but it's a different composition than the walls; I suspect it's a storage room of some kind." 

Sumner eyed the wall doubtfully. "No telling if it'll even be useful. Is there a way in?" 

Connor shrugged. "I'm clairvoyant, not kinetic. Get somebody down here with a jackhammer and find out." 

"We don't have time for that," Sumner said grimly. "You said you can sense degradation. What's the weakest point in this wall?" 

The wall was a façade; the stone wasn't weight-bearing and it hadn’t all been built at the same time. Still, some of the mortar had subtle fault lines that would, in a few more decades maybe, begin to crack. Rather than explain that this mortar was as far removed from the limestone and clay of the 19th century as a bottle rocket was from a spaceship, Connor pointed to a spot about three feet off the ground where the old and new construction connected. 

Sumner nodded, then pulled a knife from a sheath Connor hadn't even noticed. He used it to scratch the surface of the mortar, which despite its age showed no obvious signs of cracking or crumbling. He managed to score the mortar, but no more, before he drove the knife about a centimeter into the wall. Then he spun, a motion so abrupt Connor had trouble following it, and kicked the pommel with enough force that Connor flinched. He couldn't believe the blade didn't bend. 

Sumner grinned. "Don't try that at home, kid. You'll just get a bruise. Even if you're strong enough to make a difference, the impact will go through your foot, not the wall." He tapped the heel of his boot against the ground. "You need reinforced gear for that trick."  

That trick hadn't broken down the wall, but Connor didn't point that out. The more physically-oriented GeneEs could be prickly and he didn’t want to ruin Sumner’s newly-improved mood. 

Sumner kicked the knife a few more times before reaching into his breast pocket. He pulled out a pen and unscrewed its cap; not a pen, then, a tube. Connor hadn't noticed such a small amount of an innocuously-shaped substance earlier, but now that he was focused on it, he recognized it as plastic explosive.

Startled, Connor turned his 'DAR toward studying the Colonel's gear. He'd already identified his uniform as being military-grade fabric, but now that he was paying attention, he realized that the officer's white collar appearance hid an arsenal of military gear. Some of the substances he didn't recognize, but others—the telescopic baton in a spine sheath, the flashlight that was doubtless able to produce a lethal laser, the small stereo that in retrospect was probably a sonic weapon useful for crowd control situations—he felt stupid for dismissing. 

The Technocrats' Guard was the only large-scale military organization in the world. One battalion of Peacekeepers—no more than a thousand soldiers—kept the entire population of Eurasia peaceful. Of course the Technocracy's propaganda arm helped and so did the GeneE support staff, but he shouldn't have been surprised that even the officers were walking arsenals. 

"Should we move?" Connor asked nervously as Sumner finished squeezing the explosive into the hole he'd made. 

Sumner shrugged and pushed a long, thin detonator into the middle of the putty. It looked like a clear plastic toothpick until he bent it upwards at a 45 degree angle. "Might as well. Shrapnel." 

Connor would have hurried, but the Colonel took his time walking around the corner. About fifteen seconds after they settled into place in the middle of the hallway, the explosion went off. It was quieter than Connor had expected, not that he’d ever witnessed demolition in real life before. 

He breathed out, relieved. Nobody got hurt and the explosion breached the wall without damaging any of the support struts. 

Sumner grunted and walked around to investigate. “Help me clear the rubble so we can get inside.” 

The explosion loosened the mortar but wasn’t strong enough to reduce the stone blocks to anything Connor would have called rubble. They were heavy, besides; the mortar hadn’t exactly disintegrated. Sumner had to use his knife to leverage some of the more stubborn sections. 

Eventually, they managed to clear a wide enough space to squeeze a body through, even one as muscular as the Colonel. 

“Computers.” Sumner sounded disgusted. 

Without the stone in the way to fuzz the signal, it was easier for Connor to sense details about the room. “Not just computers. There are cages, too. For animals, maybe. And scientific equipment. I think that’s an organ printer.” 

“Is there anything we can *use?*” 

“I’m a doctor, not a researcher. These things look at least a hundred years out of date. Maybe there’s data on a drive about a wireless protocol that can be used to disable the mechs, or a program to turn the Academy shields into a weapon.” Connor shrugged helplessly. “Maybe it’s some long dead Director’s private lab. Won’t know until we look.” 

Sumner’s fingers clenched into fists. “Find something. I’ve got a siege to deal with.” 

Connor eyed the mass of ancient technology. It beat trying to crowd into the cafeteria with everyone else, but it wasn’t his area of expertise. He needed Dee, but wasn’t dumb enough to ask for another person to help. Sumner had already written off the whole adventure. “Sure thing. Can I borrow your flashlight?” 

Clairvoyance was great but humans had evolved eyes for a reason. 

## 9. Professional [M]

Demetrius flashed a billfold at a series of guards, too quickly for her to make out what was inside. Some indicator of rank, she assumed. Unlike the other Peacekeepers at the Academy, he wore none. 

The kitchen itself was bigger than anything she had ever seen, even at her father’s compound in Luxembourg. The communal kitchens in the preserve fed hundreds, but it was simpler fare—bread, soup, brisket, pizza—and frozen foods were relatively rare, thanks to limitations on power consumption. 

Some of the equipment here she’d never seen before. 

Demetrius, of course, had no such culture shock. "I hate to be the bearer of bad news, Major, but you can't keep secrets at the Academy the way you can with other civilian populations. The telepaths out there in the cafeteria are not going to quietly wait for you to tell them what’s going on.” 

"Half of those people are mid-level corporate recruiters," Miro said. "It's not the psychics I'm worried about panicking." 

"Separate them. The cafeteria is too small anyway."

Miro hesitated. "Protocol dictates—"

"With all due respect, Major, nobody is going to give you a commendation for following protocol if we don't stop these mechs, and we can't do that if half our attention is on keeping the civilians from rioting. By now the existence of Tele-command is known by everyone who understands TSL. We need to move everyone into the tunnels." 

That was his big idea? Meghana stopped herself from shaking her head; didn't he understand how big a threat the mechs were? "You need to blow the building up." 

Demetrius' eyebrows shot up in surprise as he turned to Meghana. "Orders? Or Tactical's suggestion?" 

"Mine." She narrowed her eyes in annoyance. "But it's true." 

Miro frowned. "Don't you think you should leave the decisions to the professionals, ma'am?" 

Demetrius opened his mouth to say something, but she was annoyed enough to beat him to a response. "Major, you haven't fought a battle like this in your entire life. You're too young to have lived through a mech battle and you're too old to remember any training you got on the topic. I, on the other hand, am a historian. Of the two of us, I have a great deal more *professional* experience related to fighting mechs than you do." 

"If you think about it for a minute, she's right.” The sniper looked pained making the admission. Or maybe that was for the Major’s benefit? Usually he kept his expression so neutral you could crack stone with it. It was a disconcerting habit. "The building's defenses are good, but the Academy was designed to be locked down during a riot, not a siege. Structural integrity is only going to hold for so long and we're in no position to fight back in the open; our mission is to protect the civilians." 

Miro closed his eyes for a moment and thought, which was something—maybe he wouldn't let his ego interfere with necessity. "There's a reason NORAD backs up into Cheyenne Mountain. Nothing beats earth and stone for siege defenses, not even those fancy alloys the physicists figured out. Let's do it." He glanced at one of the young peacekeepers who stood guard at the door. "Get everybody into the tunnels."

The constable saluted, and Meghana wondered if even now telepaths were relaying the message to the peacekeepers stationed on the other side of the cafeteria. If nothing else, GeneEs were efficient in a crisis.

Miro looked at Demetrius. "Sumner is going to shit a brick," he said once the command center had cleared of other peacekeepers. 

"He can try to have us court-martialed if the Technocracy survives this mess," Demetrius said grimly. 

**::Please tell the Major that he's about to get a request. He should okay it. Your brother needs Dee's help.::**

At least the telepath treated her like a person. “Major, Tactical wants me to relay that you should approve the request you’re about to receive.”

Miro blinked, clearly too taken aback to respond immediately, but another constable popped his head in and blurted out, “Sir, one of the Academy telepaths says she’s needed in Tele-command to help with a computer glitch. Should I let her?” He had the glazed look in his eyes that told Demetrius that the telepath had been insistent. 

The major sighed. “Fine. Send somebody down with her so she doesn’t get lost. Now—”

Her implant overrode her auditory cortex. **::THIS IS AN AUTOMATED MESSAGE FOR Meghana Davies FROM Julian Davies.** 

She went rigid. Why was her father sending her an *automated* message *now* of all times? He hadn’t ever revealed anything about the synthesizers before. 

**You're getting this message because I'm dead, honey. Do you remember that summer you came to stay with me in Luxembourg, and you got sick and you had to have that surgery? I had them install synthesizer implants. I know your mother wouldn't approve, but if everything had gone well you would never have needed to know, and well, I'm afraid it was necessary after all.** 

**Speaking of necessary, get a pen.** 

She fumbled in her purse. By now Demetrius had noticed she wasn’t responding to anything he said. “I need a pen,” she said, and he handed her something. 

**The learned machines say that there's about a 40% chance that if I die in the next six months it will be because of natural causes or a normal accident, but even now the algorithms aren't perfect, and I'm not sure how much they can be trusted anymore anyway. Regardless, if it's something normal and mundane, you'll hear about it soon and either way I'll be dead. I thought you should hear it from me.** 

**Sorry.** 

And wasn’t that just like him? 

**Most likely, though, a disgruntled faction of the Technocracy have subverted, sidestepped or just plain blasted through my security and the Technocracy is about to experience a civil war. Not many people know this, but diplomats in the Technocracy don't just negotiate with the preserves; that's only about a tenth of my job. Most of what I do is navigating bureaucratic infighting and enforcing the balance of power. Technically, my office has authority over every branch of government; I am, ultimately, the Technocracy’s arbiter of power. The tiebreaker.** 

**The synthesizers and authorization codes you have access to designate you my successor. There's no one else I trust not to break the balance; empire-builders keep subverting my protégés. Don't worry: I'm not asking you to do anything. Just keep the overrides safe until things shake out, and stay on the preserve!**

It was too late for that. Maybe if her father had ever been honest about anything in his life, she wouldn’t be trapped in the middle of comic book siege. 

Connor still would be, though. She’d helped the Peacekeepers here. Maybe she didn’t regret her father’s dishonesty, after all. 

**The rebels probably won't target the preserves unless they win the war, and if they do, there's nothing you can do that we didn't already try. The great advantage of the preserves is geography; it's no coincidence that they're located in deep jungles and arctic regions, on isolated mountains and peninsulas. The Amazon is too important to risk. Keep your head down and you'll be fine.** 

*Thanks, Dad.* Why did she need the pen? 

**The Technocracy has been pretty stable for hundreds of years. Too stable, probably. We thought the preserves would be enough of a pressure valve for the rebellious sorts; nobody expected the loyalty sensors to fail so spectacularly. Either they got clever or we got complacent -- probably a bit of both, not that it matters.**  

**The important thing is, the rebels are going to target the GeneEs first. We can't tell if they're genuine genetic purists or if they know that the Guard will try to stop them, and for you it won't matter. Stay on the preserve! There's nothing you can do to help Connor. Publicly, he is my only child. The rebels are going to target him. They know the value of propaganda—that's how we found them.** 

Meghana couldn’t stop a visceral sense of horror from shuddering through her body. He’d never been happy about her relationship with Connor, but to bluntly admit that he’d been born to be her *decoy?* How could a man *do* that to someone?

**This is not a petty insurgency, easily crushed. It comes from high levels in the government. I am certain some of our top engineers are involved.** 

**I've done what I can to keep you and your mother safe. The implants will allow you to monitor satellite networks; it's where the high-level decisions get made. Not even the telepaths can breach those communications. The synthesizers aren't perfect -- there wasn't a lot of time to lay the cognitive groundwork -- but you should be able to enable the functionality if you solve this equation, better write it down: 9x-7i > 3(3x-7u).**

**Anyway, I'm sorry I couldn't spend more time with you. Good luck.**

**END OF MESSAGE::** 

Meghana stared down at the equation scribbled on her arm. Her father knew she hated math. They’d had enough fights on the topic. 

“Report,” Miro ordered, like she was one of his soldiers. 

She looked at Demetrius instead. “My dad is dead. He suspects a faction of technocrats unhappy with the existence of the GeneEs and gave me access to the diplomatic corps’ satellites. He expects civil war and hopes I’ll stay safe on the preserves.”

Miro winced. “You still think we ought to hunker down and hope this gets sorted out, then?” 

“Do *you* want to go out there and take on one of those things hand-to-hand?” Demetrius asked.

Miro looked away. They could all still hear the steady *boom! … boom! … boom!* of rockets impacting against the Academy walls. 

## 10. Babysitter [D]

Somehow, Demetrius wound up in charge of found up the small team to be tasked with collapsing the Academy’s internal structures in on themselves at the right moment. Since he was a sniper, typically tasked with solo assassination missions more in keeping with old-style black ops espionage than demolition runs, the situation struck  him as slightly ridiculous, although he knew how it had happened. 

Of the 800 soldiers in the Eurasian Battalion, only about 35 were actually present on the Academy grounds despite the presence of both Colonel Sumner and Major Miro. The seven members of Tele-command’s guard squad, plus three squads comprising a single platoon, the lieutenant of which Demetrius genuinely pitied.

In terms of rank, this made Demetrius the 4th highest ranking Peacekeeper present. Since there was nothing to shoot at, he wound up gophering for command jobs that required authority. 

He touched base with each squad’s sergeant and pulled their best demolition expert into a meeting with some of the Academy staffers he’d had gathered together. The building operations chief had been off work for graduation, but his deputy was in the building when the Director initiated lockdown. They’d also unexpectedly managed to find one of the campus’ IT people, Corbie Anvier. She’d come in on her off day to take advantage of the campus library for an engineering project her adolescent daughter was working on for school. 

The seven of them (Corbie refused to be parted from her daughter, whose name turned out to be Sofie) hashed out a plan to blow the Academy, though Demetrius had to promise to be personally responsible for the daughter’s safety before Corbie agreed to help cannibalize materials for a remote detonation device. 

They had refined Meghana’s idea, of course. The operations deputy took two of the demolitions experts down to the  Demetrius and Sofie headed down into the tunnels. They were extensive enough that the Peacekeepers were forced to patrol sections in order to keep in touch with the rest of the team, which meant everyone had been forced to sit single-file along the wall. On the one hand, it kept the noise down since there were only so many conversations that could happen, but on the other, at some point people were going to need to go to the bathroom and things were going to get ugly. 

Thankfully, it wasn't his problem. He just had to get Sofie downstairs to Tele-command with him, so he could touch base with Sumner and, more importantly, the Tactical team. Hopefully, Sumner had come up with something, and wasn't just spending his time reaming out Miro for taking initiative. 

"How much farther?" Sofie asked. 

"A couple more floors." It had been a long time since Demetrius spent any kind of time around anyone this young, especially if you ignored the trainees in the Peacekeeper creches, who had more in common with Spartan kings than the average student engineer.  Figuring that the best way to distract her was to strike up a conversation, he asked, “What kind of project were you working on?”

She stopped walking and stared at him for a long moment, then sighed. "It's stupid." 

"It can't be that stupid if your mom thought the Academy's library would help," Demetrius pointed out in a tone he hoped was more 'reasonable' than 'condescending,' though he wasn’t sure anyone with a hairstyle that had more in common with a plasma globe than anything human would be able to tell the difference. "It must have been pretty complicated." 

She shrugged and shoved her hands into the pockets of her coruscating rainbow jumpsuit. Or were they called rompers when girls wore them? "It's not worth dying for or anything." 

"Nobody is going to die." This was so far above his pay grade. *Why did I let them talk me into this?* He thought about pointing out that they were safer inside the Academy than in town, but she probably had family and friends in the city -- it wouldn't make her feel better, so he settled for, "The Academy is very well-protected." 

She snorted. "Yeah, that's why you're trying to get my mom to help blow it up." 

She had him there. "It's just a backup plan, in case our backup doesn’t get here in time. Peacekeepers like to be prepared." 

She rolled her eyes. "Right, like you were prepared for a mech attack." 

He forced himself to stay calm and politely curious. "How would you have prepared?" 

"It's not like EMPs are heavy to carry or anything. Why don't you have any you can shoot at the stupid mechs?" 

There was so much ignorance in that statement that if she'd been an adult he'd have turned his back on her. Instead, since she couldn’t have been more than thirteen, he started walking again to give himself time to think. How best to explain that EMPs were useful for terrorists and rebels but not generally the preferred weapons of the Technocracy's agents, whose advantages were dependent on the technology that electromagnetic pulses wiped out? Besides which, an e-bomb small enough for a Peacekeeper to carry would be useless; at that point, they might as well have brought a regular rocket to shoot at the treads. 

"They don't work like in the VR games. EMPs are unpredictable and any EMP big enough to hurt a mech can hurt *us,* too."

"On come on. A place like this doesn't have a faraday cage? They can't be that hard to build." She had just enough knowledge to get herself in trouble. 

He wanted to pinch the bridge of his nose; he was the wrong person to be explaining this. He wasn't a teacher, much less a physicist. Still, he'd been a Peacekeeper long enough to know which weapons were viable when. "How do we know the mech's electronics aren't tucked away inside a faraday cage, too?" 

Her hands flew energetically as she talked. "Power surges mess up electronics all the time. There's got to be something you can do that's a little more elegant than *dropping a building on them.*" 

Not really; that was what surge protection was for. Impatience made him speed up his gait. "Exactly what kinds of projects does your school have you working on?" 

She was stubborn enough to lengthen her stride keep up. "Ugh, we build mazes, mostly. Like scavenger hunts, I guess. They make us compete to see whose courses are hardest to solve, who can complete courses fast enough. Project based learning. It's stupid. Lots of RFID doors and soldering together solar panels. It's totally antiquated." 

He grinned at that. "You know they still make the anti-piracy guys learn how to sail? I had to learn how to shoot a bow and arrow before they'd let me use a gun." 

She blinked at him in surprise. "Really? Like with wood canvas and everything? That's stupid." 

He'd thought so at the time, too. Funny how adulthood changed your perspective. "It helps build fundamentals. It's easier to see the wind move an arrow than a bullet, but bullets still move. You have to understand how it works the easy way before they'll teach you the hard stuff."

"Not like that's helping anybody with the stupid mechs." 

About two switchbacks away from tele-Command, he saw the Director. Seeing her long, cheap crystal earrings somehow reminded him of computer chips. He bared his teeth as an idea hit him. "Not yet." 

Sofia eyed him suspiciously. "What do you mean?" 

"Just because an EMP would be too dangerous doesn't mean there aren't other solutions we can try. It's always good to have backup plans, right?" He stopped in front of the Director and waited for her to acknowledge him. "Director, the Academy has physicists on staff, right?" 

"Of course." She sounded a little offended he even had to ask. 

He smiled at her. "Any chance you could introduce us?" 

## 11. Martyr [C]

Connor was flipping through old, handwritten journals filled with equations he didn't have the physics to understand when he started to sense a mass of people at the edges of his perception range. 

"What's going on?" he asked Dee, who had somehow gotten the computer turned on but was still trying to figure out its antiquated UI. He said the words out loud so she'd know they were directed at her, specifically. Like most telepaths she was in the habit of politely ignoring internals. 

She barely looked up. "They're bringing everyone into the tunnels. Your sister convinced them to blow up the Academy. She's on her way here. Try not to let her jog my elbow: I think I've almost cracked this thing." 

Connor grunted acknowledgment and went back to trying to make sense of the notes. He was pretty sure now that the physics notations were related to interstellar distances; there seemed to be a couple of different planets in the Gliese catalogue being compared,  not by distance or habitability as far as he could tell, but by the amount of stuff projected to be in the way. There were references to the galactic tide and molecular clouds and the projected paths of other stars, but Meghana arrived before he could figure out the *goal* of all this research. 

“Dad’s dead,” she said. No preamble. Maybe she knew he wouldn’t take the news personally. 

“I bet a lot of people are,” Connor said. “No way is this an isolated disaster.” 

“You don’t care?” *And maybe not.*

He looked up from the logbook. “He was your dad, not mine. If my genetic code is a cocktail, he wasn’t the bartender—he was the drunk.”

“I’m sorry.” 

He shrugged helplessly. “It’s fine. The Guard doesn’t get families. That’s what the Academy is for.” He kicked himself for the statement as soon as he said it; it was a common refrain at the Academy, so obviously true on the face of it that he hadn't even thought before the words left his lips. But Meghana had a preservist's notion of *family* and didn't care that their genetic overlap was so miniscule she'd have been better off trying to play big sister to almost literally any other unmodified human over him. At best he had, what, some carefully calibrated physical resemblance to her father?  

She was his daughter, the old-fashioned way. Connor was just a vanity project. He'd come to terms with it. 

Still, he wasn't surprised at all when Meghana's eyes narrowed. “You have me. And mom.” 

That was true, of course—and a fact that had been a source of pride and awkwardness by turns during his tenure with the Academy. Sure, other psychics had gotten mail, but their relationships had much more in common with the connection between Julian and himself; one of sponsorship, of legacy -- not warmth. 

"You don't get it, Meg. I shouldn't have invited you." He'd been proud of his accomplishments, though, academic and otherwise. Even for a clairvoyant, neurosurgery was not an easy course of study and the nice thing about genetic engineering was that it had a way of levelling the playing field. Nobody at the Academy was *inherently* any smarter than anyone else. They all started with pretty much the same amount of raw intelligence, insofar as genetics had the ability to impact cognition. 

Not that his intelligence was doing him any favors right now. 

Meghana was pretty pissed. "Don't you dare try to make this into some kind of twisted martyrdom. This isn't your fault." 

"It's not about fault." He strived for patience. "If I hadn't invited you, you wouldn't be here."

"Would that be such a bad thing? I've helped." 

He stared at her. "Let's see. You got taken hostage, you're trapped in the middle of a mechanoid siege, and oh yeah, you blew up the Academy!" 

She snorted. "Hardly. Peacekeepers did that. Which honestly is impressive. I wasn't sure they'd be able to find enough explosives." 

"It was your idea." 

"The decision to try and overthrow the government had nothing to do with either of us, Connor." 

"Bullshit! They didn't attack the Academy as some critical component of a clever coup. The rebels are deliberately targeting GeneEs. This is someone's attempt at a genetic cleansing of the 'human race.' It is *definitely* about me. You're always so insistent on seeing me as family that you never see *me.*" He was embarrassed to realize he was shouting. 

She took a half-step back. "We'll talk more later. This isn't helping anything. Just. Remember that you *do* have a family." She turned and left the room. 

Meghana had only gone a couple of feet when Dee signed, "She really loves you."

He sighed. "Yeah. So?" 

Dee shrugged and went back to fiddling with the computer. 

He'd always been able to count on the telepaths to remind him that Meghana wasn't faking her way through an unwanted familial duty. Unlike the scores of businessmen winding their way into the tunnels, she wanted nothing from him but a relationship. He *should* be grateful. 

He *should* go after her, apologize, explain that he was just worried, that he wished she was somewhere safe. He had almost decided to swallow his pride when Dee pounded a fist on the desk in triumph. 

"It's a teleporter." 

He blinked at her. "What?" 

"Well, not the computer. But this program is designed to operate a teleportation device." She shook her head in shared disbelief then pointed at a cluttered corner of equipment they hadn't gone through yet. "This whole thing must have been some scientist's pet project during the middle years of the Green Rebellion. I think they tried terraforming some planet they thought could be made habitable and seeded it with animals they were afraid of losing."

"What is the point of that?" Connor asked, baffled. "It's not like they'd be able to get them back." 

Dee shrugged. "Your sister is a preservationist, right? Maybe you should ask her to explain the logic." 

He ignored the jibe. "Does Tele-command know?" 

Dee nodded. "But no one is going to tell Sumner until we find out more. Come on. Let's see if the tech even works. Maybe we can figure out a way out of here." She grinned. "Which preserve did you say your sister was from? Maybe we should visit."  

Connor rolled his eyes and started moving equipment out into the hallway. 

It was heavier than it looked. 

## 12. Cutter [D]

In the end, Demetrius had been right. An EMP was so impractical a solution as to be impossible. However, between them, a couple of instructors thought they had figured out 

Which was 

## 13. Volunteer [M]

“Relay my order to all members of the Eurasian battalion: they are to converge on the Academy and attempt to provide a relief effort.” 

“Done,” Meghana said. 



“So you want us to attempt mass suicide?” 



FOR THE GOOD OF HUMANITY, SURRENDER. 

SURRENDER AND ALL UMOS WILL BE SPARED. 

“Do we even have any UMOs 

Meghana said nothing. They wouldn’t submit to a slaughter just to save her life, and she wouldn’t ask them to. 

Meghana had eyes only for her brother. “I’ll go first.” 

Sumner looked at her like she was mad. “No. You’ll wait here, with me. I want to know the instant you receive any indication that anything has changed out there.” 

Couldn’t he see that Meghana wanted nothing more than to stop the barrage of disaster moving through her mind? 

“I’ll go,” Demetrius said. “I’m used to operating in unknown territory without any support.”

## TERMS

1. The **Academy of Psychic Sciences** is the only university empowered to training of clairvoyants and telepaths. Indoctrination and loyalty to the Technocracy is a large part of their training. The outer facade of the building is red brick; graduations take place in a beautiful central plaza. It is located in Geneva, Switzerland near where the Rhône River meets Lake Geneva. See also: *tele-command*.
2. **Clairvoyants** compromise a variety of specialties, the most common of which are far-seers and micro-sensors. In addition to highly specialized genetic engineering, they are fitted with a suite of advanced, artificial ‘dar organs (as in “radar” and “sonar”) during childhood that only their carefully engineered brains have the capacity to interpret.  
3. **GeneEs** are *Gene*tically *E*ngineered humans. Most humans are genetically engineered in some way (genetic diseases have been all but eliminated) but some genetic templates are heavily restricted by the government. 
4. **Genekits** are a set of standard modifications for a particular type of genetic engineering. The term applies not just to the typical alterations made to members of he Technocrats’ Guard, but also to modification groupings for longevity, physical beauty, etc., that are legal for  the general population.
5. **Preservists** are humans who have opted out of the technocracy and live on isolated reserves located throughout the world, including Baja California,the Amazon Basin, and the Congo River region. Their mission is to preserve ancient skills like weaving and butter-making against a time of need. Most preservists are UMOs (see: *unmodified organisms*). 
6. The **Technocrats’ Guard** (also known as the *Peacekeepers*) are genetically modified to be stronger, faster, and healthier than the general population. They are raised in creches to essentially become supersoldiers. 
7. The **Technocracy** became Earth’s global government following the “technocoup,” a brutal global civil war precipitated by the instability following global warming in the 21st century. It is run by big data programs and machine learning… which means that programmers are the leaders of the new global government. See also: *the green rebellion*.
8. **Tele-command** is a hidden operations center located far enough beneath the Academy of Psychic Sciences as to be undetectible by radar. It is manned by telepaths 
9. **Telepaths** are genetically engineered humans with specialized artificial organs able to detect human thoughts from a distance, which they supplement with thought-controlled communications suites able to project to properly calibrated communication devices known as synthesizers. Their genetic modifications *always* result in mutism; “telepath sign language” (TSL) was developed for their use in face-to-face communications during emergencies. 
10. **The Green Rebellion** was a 50 year of civil war compromised of ancient governments defending the status quo on one side, hackers and scientists on the other, and rioters in between. The nation-states were championed by mechs, tanks, and robots, while the technocrats primarily used advanced machine learning and genetic engineering. The technocrats won, instituting strict climate controls to salvage the environment after decades of floods, desertification and war. 
11. **Unmodified Organisms** (also known as *UMOs*) have not undergone any genetic engineering more technical than selective breeding. 

## EARTH

### Fashion

- Academy educators wear antiquated suits in bland colors like gray, brown and navy. 
- Corporate fashion utilizes the latest technology, including fabrics made of configurable displays. 
- Preservists typically wear bright, natural, handmade fabrics. 
- Peacekeepers have access to “superflex” fabrics, which look like business suits but are flexible, durable, and double as armor. They stiffen in reaction to abrupt pressure like a blow or a bullet.
