## Summary

A devastated [[Irella]] collapses into tears in the semi-privacy of the palace showers. Rather than waiting to hear more from official channels, Irella approaches the new Sovereign, Eramepi's sister Valentia and demands to know who is at fault. Valentia insists that no one is to blame for bloodspot fever, but Irella is adamant that better sanitation could have saved him. Valentia, more concerned with the economic and political situation, sidelines Irella, who was a decisive military force during the Unification War, to the minor, ceremonial role of tomb-builder.

# Chapter 02

Irella didn't dare try to approach Valentia with her robes still dirty and torn, so the second she stepped foot into the palace—making sure to use one of the little-used side entrances—she asked a runner to fetch her a fresh set of robes from the small room Eramepi had ordered set aside for her use. Then, she made her way toward the closest bathing stall, the one normally used by the courtyard laborers. 

Alem, uncharacteristically grave, took up a post outside the door. The moment she was finally alone, hot tears welled up. She squeezed her eyes shut, biting her lip to keep the sounds of weakness from escaping as she undressed and opened up the water pipe. 

Sun-warmed water from the palace cisterns, normally a privilege she luxuriated in, sluiced over her body, barely felt as she cried. 

Eramepi had been her savior, her patron, and—in the end, her friend. He had taken her, a barbarian child orphaned by raiders, and given her a home, a faith, and a purpose. He had been the star by which she sailed her life, and now, he was gone. 

She wanted to keen her fury at the unfairness of the universe, but even now, curled up miserable and alone in the cramped confines of a laborers' bath, she dared not call attention to her barbarian heritage with such an open display of emotion. 

She had to get herself under control. She owed it to Eramepi to be worthy of the place he had made for her in Lysaria. She was a priestess of the Architect. A thaumaturge with a direct connection to the divine. 

When her heartbeat slowed, when she could breathe again, she dried herself with a thick square of linen and went to check if her robes had arrived.

The palace functionary who brought her clean robes said that Valentia was meeting with General Dagrim in the inner courtyard. Two functionaries stood guard in the archway that led from the gardens to the inner courtyard repeated Valentia's order that she not be disturbed. 

Irella considered waiting outside the door, then tightened her lips. 

Eramepi was dead. 

They would never let an unauthorized visitor pass; she would be lucky to convince them to even ask Valentia for an audience, and she was in no mood to be slotted into a queue with every other supplicant seeking the new Sovereign's ear. 

Instead, Irella nodded politely and walked away. She kept going west, around the corner of the grand hall that separated the two outdoor areas, until she stood outside the throne room. With Eramepi gone and , it stood empty and unguarded. 

"Valentia isn't here," Alem pointed out. 

"Eramepi worried about assassination attempts when Oruku ceded to him without so much as a battle," she told Alem in a low voice. "I mapped the palace very thoroughly and made a few alterations."  

Valentia would not be pleased at the reminder that *her* safety depended on *Irella's* goodwill, but there was no help for it. Irella climbed stairs that led to the gilded throne and then reached behind it, pushing her fist into a particular stone. The wall parted smoothly, revealing a narrow passage.  

A bare moment later, she closed the tunnel behind her. Alem hissed a startled breath as the room went dark, but shuffled along beside her, fingers surprisingly loud as they traced the wall. 

She traversed the tunnel by memory, but Alem had no such advantage. He nearly walked into the wall after brushing past her. With an apologetic wince, Irella leaned against the corner and reached out at hip height until she found the other push-stone.

Valentia's distinctive cloak of imported silk whispered as she turned, heavy brows furrowed in annoyance. "I left orders that I was not—" She sighed when she caught sight of Irella. "I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. Was there something unclear about my proclamation?" 

"People don't die of bloodspot fever, amir-Valentia." She hated to offer the honorific, but it would be foolish to antagonize Valentia more than she already had. "I came to find out what is going on."  

It was an unpleasant disease, to be sure, but not deadly. Victims got a rash. Their joints hurt and their head pounded. Maybe they vomited; she hadn’t, when she’d caught the fever on campaign outside [[Keldehss]]. 

"People don't *usually* die of bloodspot fever." [[Dagrim]] ran his hands through his short gray hair. "It does happen." 

"There is something else going on here," Irella said stubbornly. "We have to find out what happened."

Valentia sighed, exhaustion carving lines into her face as she allowed herself to relax. "Or you'll what, nin-Irella? Rebel? With whose help?" Irella's gaze flicked to General Dagrim, more out of confusion than anything else, and Valentia laughed bitterly. "I assure you, if the General thought he could do a better job of holding the League together than I will, you would have found me bleeding out on the courtyard stones." 

Dagrim's porcine nose flared as he snorted. "Valentia, please. I would have arranged things a bit more neatly than that."

"You're right," Valentia said, touching the General's bare arm with apparent fondness, though Dagrim was easily twice her age. "You would have made sure whoever discovered my body was part of your scheme." 

Irella's mind spun with shock. Valentia's refusal to wed Sargov of Keldehss had been the flashpoint that led to the Unification War. If she was now willing to entertain even the notion of a political marriage...  or was that fond touch just a facade to keep Dagrim loyal? 

Irella never was any good at understanding Valentia's schemes. She pushed the attempt aside. " I know you've never liked me, amir-Valentia, but I've given your family nothing but loyalty since I was a child. I have no intention of seeking out a rebellion or a secession." 

"It's not that I don't like you," Valentia said softly, sounding more vulnerable than Irella had ever heard before. "I suspect you would no more seek to put someone else on Eramepi's throne than pry open your own chest. But you're a liability, and I'm still not sure Eramepi was right to insist on your investiture with the Temple." 

"The Architect has chosen to channel his power through me." Irella's response was stiff, but it wasn't the first time she'd made this point. "It is not for mortals to second-guess that decision." 

"Yes, I'm sure your *biladiyn* agrees with your theological position, nin-Irella, but I don't have the luxury of ignoring the reality of the political situation. You're Voldshee. I know you can't help the unfortunate circumstances of your foreign birth, but the fact of it remains."

"I just want to understand how a man in his prime could be struck down by a minor swamp disease. Bloodspot fever shouldn't be able to spread through a proper camp." Once, it had been Irella's duty to ensure Eramepi's armies knew how to bivouac safely.  

"I don't have time to worry about what petty minutiae might have kept Eramepi alive, Irella, as satisfying as it might be. I'm busy doing what I can to keep the League from dissolving into a pile of self-centered princes fighting over scraps. There are a lot of powerful people who would be happy to see our city-states along the Lysar to rot like corpses in the sun." 

Irella winced at the unfortunate visual, but didn't let it stop her. "But if someone is responsible for your brother's death—" 

"Enough! You're grieving, nin-Irella. I understand. I am grieving too. But there is no one to blame for this, and even if there were, we have more important things than revenge to consider." She took a deep breath. "The League will stay together if the Temples and the nobles think its in their best interests. When Eramepi had an army at his back, there was no benefit to rebellion. Now?" 

Irella looked pointedly at General Dagrim. Clearly, Valentia hadn't lost the army. 

Dagrim spread his hands helplessly. "I'm a good general, but I'm not Eramepi. It takes a Prince or a genius to keep an army big enough to cow a city from fragmenting into pieces or rampaging over the populace. Right now, I'm first among equals. Unless I become more than that, I wouldn't dare ask another General to put their men under my banner, even to discipline a wayward city." 

Irella hid a wince. A rebellious Prince wouldn't act without at least one general as his ally. Irella wondered who Valentia thought so likely to be a problem that she was willing to let Dagrim court her. 

"Right now, I don't have power. I have a couple seasons' worth of habit and the promise of prosperity to dangle like bread on a fisherman's hook. I want that prosperity for the League. I want you to be a part of that prosperity." Valentia looked pained. "In three days, the army will have brought Eramepi's body home." 

"To Marna?" Irella blurted, confused by the apparent *non sequitor*. Marna was at least a decan away from Oruku by flatboat. 

Valentia glared at her. "To his *home* in the palace in the *capitol* of the League he helped create. If you want to *help,* instead of railing against the unfairness of the gods, you could handle the memorial designs. Your High Priest won't interfere; he has other concerns." The new Sovereign softened her gaze. "I can trust you to give him the resting place he deserves, nin-Irella. You knew him better than most." 

Irella swallowed. Valentia wasn't really giving her a choice. "I'll build him a [[2020.09.07 Tombs|tomb]] even the gods would envy," she promised.

Valentia stared at her for a long moment, then nodded, "Good. Now go back the way you came, and don't visit me without an appointment again. " 

Irella bowed and left.

Irella threw her whole being into building Eramepi's tomb. For three days and nights she drew sketches, made calculations, and pulled raw aether into the mortal world. *Biladiyn* stood guard, first Alem and later others. She ate mechanically whenever food was offered, slept only when her eyes blurred and hands shook, and if any of her superiors from the Temple of the Architect came to demand an accounting of her work, she ignored them so thoroughly that she couldn’t recall their faces.

Finally, as the setting sun turned the Lysar river red, the tomb stood complete. The isosceles trapezoid, translucent enough to see the crystalline channels shot through the divine stone, towered over the central palace courtyard. Water from the terrace aqueducts flowed through the channels, and when his bones were interred, they would be protected by the Lysar itself.

Irella's first impulse had been to place the tomb in the center of the Lysar, for all to see, and remember — but, in the end, had been unwilling to disrupt the fishermen and traders who depended on the river for their livelihoods.

Instead, she'd focused her efforts on the design. Nine stelae towered over the tomb, one for each of the Lysarian cities Eramepi had come to rule. Aetherock was a poor substance for intricate relief work, but she’d willed it into line, and each stela detailed the story of how each had come under his aegis, some by siege and others through bribery and once, through single combat with the champion of a noble house. 

“Were you there for all of that?” Alem asked quietly as she sipped water from a ceramic cup someone had set beside her. She could taste the dust on its surface.

"Most of it," Irella said. "Thaumaturges have pretty wide latitude, it's not as though Eramepi was trying to destroy any cities. We didn't so much as scratch the city walls.  Eramepi was pretty clearly on the side of spreading civilization." 

"I'm not sure the Temples in [[Keldehss]] would agree," Alem said. 

Irella's lips tightened. "I could make the argument that the gods were clearly on our side, but in the end? Sargov put Marna under siege for *seasons* because Eramepi found another source of bronze and refused to split the trade — which is the only reason he wanted to marry amir-Valentia in the first place. My parents *died* because of all the stupid Nahrian raids Eramepi put a stop to.  I don't really care what they think." 

Her parents, like most of the Voldshee, rarely ventured down from the mountains. But they’d had timber to trade, and the hunting that year had been bad enough to warrant the risk of raiders; they'd gambled and lost their lives. 

Too young to fight back, she'd been chained to a cart bound for the slave-ships that ported in Arais before Eramepi rescued her. 

“I’m sorry,” Alem said. "The two of you seemed close." 

"We believed in each other," Irella said, staring at the memorial because bring herself to consider the future. 

Her sovereign considered her a liability. Her High Priest hated her. Most people in Oruku thought she was a barbarian witch, and half of her own guards thought she was a heretic. 

Irella sat and, as the sky turned black, mourned.
