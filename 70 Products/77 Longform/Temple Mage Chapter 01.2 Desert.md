# Chapter 01.2

Kia took the other end of the tow-rope and looped it through through the bow. She felt foolish as they pulled the canoe into the desert, but though the river ran too shallow for the heirloom to float, even as a sled—even across dry, cracked earth—it was better than carrying everything by hand.

With a strength she hadn’t seen from him in weeks, Khent taught her how to walk the sands, sticking to the shaded troughs between the scrub-dotted dunes. Each step still felt strange, far more uncertain than the loamy soil of the narrow floodplain that Senva’s Ford straddled.

The bright sun above sucked the moisture from her skin as surely as it parched the earth, beating down from a cloudless sky, but Kia was too excited to complain. The dunes soon leveled out into a golden expanse of rolling hills and furrows that were somehow stark despite the low-lying bushes and scrubby brown growths lined the meandering edges of the dunes. The wind rustled the dry branches, but Kia heard no other sounds; no toads, no flies, no gentle splashes. It was eerie.

She’d heard stories all her life about the Midire Desert—many from her mother, born in a western oasis and left the caravans when she was only a little younger than Kia was now—but somehow Kia hadn’t expected the horizon to be so big. Over the valley ridge, once they’d left the Aakari basin behind them, she could see for leagues. In the distance, everything blurred into sandy browns and rocky gray, but up close, the greens and reds and golds were arresting in their vividness.

Khent looked back often, marking their progress, so Kia did as well, trying to fix the landmarks in her mind. That tree looked like it had roots instead of branches. This patch of grass was crescent like the moon. Those bushes had long since lost their leaves.

After awhile, when Kia glanced toward home, she could no longer make out the ridge that marked the valley’s edge. “How far are we going to go?”

“Getting tired?” Khent asked.

She didn’t want to admit anything short of absolute enthusiasm for what had, after all, been her idea. “No, I just—” Kia shrugged. She had never been so far from the river before. If something happened to her father, if he got too tired or collapsed from the heat—“I realized I don’t know how to get home, is all.”

Khent smiled and said in the same voice he had used to teach her how to string a net, “Never rely on green things in the desert; they have a way of changing. The mountains are the bones of the earth. Let them be your guide.” He pointed south, and Kia peered into the distance. “Do you see that outcropping, the one that looks like a camel’s hump?”

She saw mountains; they all looked like camel humps.

“Not the highlands,” he said. “Look lower.”

Kia adjusted her focus and finally noticed the rock formation he was talking about. Once she found it, she felt stupid: it was obvious now that she knew what to look for. “Yes.”

“Good. That is where we are going.”

Kia nodded and glanced at the sky. The sun had edged toward mid-afternoon, lengthening the shadows enough to make her worry whether she’d be home by dusk.

“Almost there,” her father repeated. “Let’s go.”

Kia focused on pulling as much of the weight of the canoe as she could. To take her mind off the ache in her arms—if she’d been a boy, her muscles would have grown, she was sure of it—Kia studied the patterns in the sand, like her mother might have before she lost her legs and was sent to live with the weavers.

Father noticed what she was doing and pointed at the side of the nearest dune. “This is fresh, see? The wind hasn’t disturbed it much.”

“Where?” She struggled to dampen her frustration; she’d wanted to learn, but hated this feeling of incompetence.

“Stop and drink something,” he urged. “Look closely. In the desert, you must always look closely.”

As Kia sipped warm well water from her goatskin canteen, she stared at the spot where her father had pointed. Even with help, it took her a long moment before she saw the tiny ridge—more of a long bump, really—that bulged slightly outward along the surface of the dune.

“Many of the desert creatures burrow in the heat of the day,” he explained. “They won’t stray far from food.”

Kia returned her waterskin to the boat and they continued dragging it behind them. Liquid sloshed in her empty belly, but she ignored it as best she could.

They walked at least a league from home before they came to another ridge. Kia’s calves ached as they climbed it, and she was about to suggest stopping for more water when a hawk cried out. She looked up to scan the sky.

She might have walked over the edge if the boat hadn’t gotten heavy when she tried to step forward; Khent had stopped pulling. The tension jerked Kia out of her walking daze and she stared dumbly at the flat, white plain at the bottom of the crater. A few scrubby trees stretched upward toward the sky, but little else seemed to live below.

“Where are we? How did you learn about this place?” Kia asked as her father handed her his half of the tow-rope. Almost automatically, she looped it around her elbow and wrist, collecting it into a neat bundle.

“This was a lake, once. In my grandfather’s time. Sometimes, the floodwaters are very strong. You know; you helped us rebuild the levee, three floods back. But that flood… it was worse than anyone has ever seen.”

“The lake dried up, though,” Kia said, confused. “How is this going to help us?”

“There is still water, beneath the salt, where only the trees can reach. The trees bring the water to the desert creatures. The Imazi used to camp here, before Jisge built the bridge. Now…” he shrugged. “As long as we leave the salt for the Imazi mages, I do not think anyone will mind if we take what we need.”

“How do we get down there?” Kia tried to imagine a caravan of camels climbing their way into the bottom of the crater, and failed. Goats, maybe—but camels?

“There is a path.”

She peered over the edge. Though the edge of the crater wasn’t sheer, to her pounding heart it definitely looked more like a cliff than a path. She had never climbed anything taller than a date palm, and that only once, moons and moons ago, dared by one of the trader girls who’d been sweet on her cousin Farein.

Still, she had come this far, and they couldn’t afford to go home empty-handed.

Khent tossed the rope into the boat, then extracted the shovel and the nets. “Grab the basket and watch where I walk,” he said, then stepped over the edge. He twisted backwards to meet her eyes. “Exactly where I walk.”

Kia picked up the basket that she’d stuffed the rest of their gear into and set it on her shoulder before following him down into the crater. Pristine sand—an entire basin of pure salt, it looked like—blew across the flat ground, insulated from the surrounding desert by the lip of the ridge they had just climbed.

Coppery trees, their gnarly branches tipped with tiny tufts of green, grew in clusters scattered around the dry lakebed, and in the distance Kia saw huge, fat-bottomed birds. Vindication pushed aside her nerves; their eggs must be huge!

Excitement increased the confidence of her pace. Together, they descended the rest of the way into the lakebed swiftly.

The drifting grains of salt made her want to sneeze, but she exhaled forcefully to stifle the urge. They made their way to the shade of a tall tree, its branches as far from the palms of the riverside as she could imagine. After a moment, though, her curiosity faded into something more practical.

“How does it live here? The salt—”

“Their taproots go very deep,” Khent explained. “We could chop it down and it would still live, refusing to cede control of the waters below, even though it lies deeper than any well well save those the mages dig.”

“Water is life.”

He nodded. “Many things live because of this tree, and perhaps so shall we. Insects eat its leaves, lizards eat the insects. Snakes and birds eat the lizards.”

Kia thought of the hawk but asked, “What will we eat?”

“Whatever is here.” Then, grimly, “Whatever we can catch.”

She eyed the ostriches and he chuckled, a regretful sound. “Probably not, they’re—”

A shadow flickered in Kia’s periphery. Instinctively, she looked up. A scream escaped before her mind had time to fully interpret the shape; too big for an eagle.

"Get the nets!" Khent shouted as the wyvern spread its wings, slowing its dive enough to come at them claws first.

Kia scrambled out of the way, scrabbling along the ground. The salt stung her palms. The wyvern just barely missed striking her neck, hidden beneath her scarf and braids. She expected it take to the skies. Instead it tumbled into a roll and squirmed, snake-like, until it faced her in a coil.

Desperately, Kia fumbled with the nets until she had them open. The wyvern opened its hard, triangular snout and hissed threateningly as it watched, dancing back and forth as it waited for an opportunity to strike.

“What do we do?” Kia’s voice was high and thin with fear.

Khent held their shovel, but against a creature nearly as large as himself, there was little hope of wielding it effectively. “The net.” His voice was tight.

She would only have one chance.

Before she could take it, the wyvern lunged, pushing forward with its great wings at a speed the snake it resembled could never have matched.

Instinctively, Kia flung her net. The weights at the edges—so necessary for catching fish in the viscous course of the Aakari River—were all but useless here; the wyvern was too big, too strong.

Still, she'd put enough spin in her throw to tangle the net around its maw; it couldn't bite.

Instead, it butted her with the full force of its strike, bowling her over. Her scarf tumbled off her head and her braids smacked her face. The wyvern keened its frustration and rubbed its head furiously against the ground, trying to dislodge the netting.

In its moment of vulnerability, Khent hit it with the blunt blade of his shovel. The blow had no effect; not even the timbre of the wyvern's growl changed.

On hands and knees, Kia fled the whip-powerful flailing of the wyvern, but her father made no such retreat. Khent bludgeoned the creature, each dull thwack half-buried beneath its sounds of rage.

Kia forced herself to stop, turning around to face the tableau. She ignored the pounding of her heart. Sweat dripped down her brow; she swiped it away. For the moment, she was safe enough to think: the net made the wyvern unwieldy and kept it from biting, but hadn't trapped it. Her father's shovel kept it distracted, kept it from striking---for the moment.

Maybe the Imazi were taught how to handle wyverns, same as she had learned how to avoid whiskerfish stings and protect a catch from rotwights. If so, Kia’s mother hadn’t taught her how. She’d never wanted Kia to face one at all.

Kia pushed away thoughts of her mother and fumbled open the lid of her basket. The neatly coiled tow rope was stubborn; she had to pull it out, hand shaking. A brittle nail tore in her haste to empty the rest. Snail shells scattered into the ground.

Last came the knife. Kia gripped it in her fist and wished she had been born a boy; then, she might be bigger, stronger. Maybe they wouldn’t have come into the desert at all.

If wishes were kisses we’d all be wed.

Kia stood. She ran to position herself behind the wyvern. Heard her father shout “No!”

Leapt onto the creature’s back. Drove the small, copper blade into the line between its wings with all her might.

It bucked, throwing her into the air. The wind of its fury buffeted her as the wyvern spun to face its attacker; she landed hard, releasing her breath in a yellow daze.
