## Summary
At Eramepi's memorial, [[Irella]] reaches out to one of her few allies in Oruku, the noble trader Wanishtu. Irella is shocked when, instead of agreeing to intercede with Valentia on her behalf, Wanishtu begs her to leave Oruku without authorization and focus her efforts on supporting Marna — the one city-state that Irella would have thought would have stayed loyal to the League, since it was Eramepi's birthplace and supplied the majority of the fighting men for the Unification War.

## Notes
the honor of building the shrine should be a deliberate attempt to keep her busy, but she couldn't argue and didn't want to. It would be the BEST shrine. maybe somebody else points out that the honor is a trick and she's like IDGAF!! 

> It sounded like an opportunity.  
> It was banishment. Bring sent away from everything she knew.

# Chapter 03

Valentia's proclamation meant that all of Lysaria's most important personages had flocked to the capitol. On the morning of Eramepi's funerary rite, the palace courtyard was bore only passing resemblance to the garden she had finally left, well after moonrise, the night before. 

Marble plinths jutted up out of the coriander carpeting the courtyard, each displaying a selection of artful cakes and sculpted sweets. Irella felt her Voldshee heritage keenly. Lysarian elites were gluttonous at the best of times, but the their tendency to swarm a banquet seemed particularly obscene now. Even after fifteen years away from the mountains of her birth, her stomach tied itself in knots of stress and grief at the thought of food in the wake of a death. 

A servant appeared at her elbow even before she finished scanning the courtyard. “May I offer you refreshment?“ 

Irella’s gorge rose, but she accepted a plate so her empty hands wouldn’t mark her for further solicitation. "Thank you," she murmured. 

The woman before her did not share Irella's aversion. She speared a slice of blackcurrant pie and slid the morbid thing into her mouth without dropping a single crumb onto the golden mantle that marked her as a high-ranking treasury official. Her expression turned rapturous as she swallowed. “The Gardener’s priests have really outdone themselves,” she murmured. 

The man beside her, also clothed in the bright gold of the treasury, smirked as he accepted his own plate. “Nasha darling, what choice do they have? They let Eramepi die of *[[bloodspot fever]].*” 

Irella pushed an allium bulb through the creamy sauce on her plate and asked, as diffidently as she could, "Did they really?" 

Nasha turned toward her, taking in her height, her robes, her hair, then slowly raising her perfectly arched eyebrow. "You hadn't heard?" she offered a saccharine smile thick enough to choke a fly then shook her head. "And you his favorite priestess."

Irella consciously relaxed her jaw as Alem touched her elbow. “I think I see Wanishtu, nin-Irella. You said you needed to speak with him?” 

She’d said no such thing, but she was grateful that Alem had recognized the Marnan trader as a friendly face. Alem had guarded her the last time Wanishtu had been in Oruku on business. He'd taken her out on his flagship and taught her how to fish. Irella nodded and let Alem lead her toward the throng of traders in the shade under the east pavilion. 

Wanishtu flashed her same charismatic smile she remembered from the siege in Marna, when he’d promised to smuggle in grain from the countryside if only she could build him a way out of the starving city. 

She’d built the tunnel. He hadn’t returned. Eramepi had been so angry, raging privately about the cowardice of traders, until word came that he’d been captured by Keldehssi soldiers. 

Wanishtu still had a scar on his collarbone from the deep bite of a Keldehssi sword; he hadn't betrayed them, and his father now stood as Eramepi's proxy governor in Marna. 

Valentia's proxy, now. 

"It’s good you’re here," Wanishtu said in a low voice. "Father sent word through the Archivists' priests that the eastern logging bridge burned down this morning. He's is worried someone's trying to take advantage of Eramepi's death to cause trouble.” 

Irella's gut clenched. "So soon?" The swift sharing of knowledge the Archivist offered to His faithful was a wondrous miracle, but sometimes she wished they weren't so eager to spread *every* bit of portentous news. 

He spread his palms. “You’ve been through Keldehss more recently than I, nin-Irella. What do you think?”

"That depends," Irella said slowly. "On whether or not Eramepi really died of bloodspot fever."

Wanishtu offered her a crooked smile. "My cousin saw the rash himself, and a couple of my father’s men who were with him got sick around the same time.”

“They recovered though?” Irella asked, tamping down her irrational anger as best she could when he nodded. Truly, she did not wish ill on men who had done nothing but survive when Eramepi had not. She didn't. But she had to close her eyes for a moment anyway. 

“Plague is no respecter of rank, though I wouldn't want to be Eramepi's mender right now." Wanishtu sighed. "At least Valentia acted quickly to secure the succession, though it’s hard to say if she’ll be able to hold the League together. You should come with me back to Marna. Father and I can protect you there.” 

"Eramepi isn't even entombed yet, and here we are speculating about the politics of it all," Irella said bitterly. 

Wanishtu rubbed his face tiredly, the most human gesture she'd seen from him in years. "The best way to honor him is to protect his legacy, Irella. You're one of the most powerful thaumaturges in the League, but you were born Voldshee.  People are going to start coming after you, with Eramepi gone."<!--Lupicin must be from Keldehss-->

"Erampi is dead! I think there are bigger things to worry about than my social standing."

“I'm trying to protect you!” he hissed. “The soldiers don’t really know Valentia; they’ll follow their generals and a lot of *them* would be happy to carve off a piece of Lysaria and rule on their own. The civil servants will keep their head down; it's not their first regime change. The Temples are the key, you're going to be a prime target and Valentia isn't going to do anything about it!”

As Valentia had made abundantly clear to her, with Eramepi gone, the new Sovereign was every bit as vulnerable as Irella. Valentia had stood beside him while the river cities of Lysaria were united, but she had been his negotiator, not his general. A lot of powerful people had been eager to put a stop to the constant raids—but plenty more had profited from the violence and the chaos. 

Before Irella could think through what Wanishtu was saying—offering—a novice appeared at her shoulder. “Excuse me, nin-Irella, I’m sorry to interrupt, but en-Avestur asked me to watch for you. He needs to speak with you.”

Irella wanted to snap at him to go away, rage at him for daring to interrupt her. It wasn't fair; the boy had even less control over his orders than she did. 

To defy her own high priest when Eramepi was alive had been a dangerous necessity. To do so now, with the League on the knife-edge of collapse, would be a spike through the heart of everything she had ever worked for. No matter what Wanishtu urged, she wasn't going to be the one who destroyed Eramepi's legacy. 

"Excuse me," she said to Wanishtu. 

"Of course," Wanishtu murmured, but his eyes were pleading. 

“Do you know what this is about?” she asked the novice, glancing around the courtyard. She hadn’t seen the High Priest when she’d come in, but that didn’t mean he hadn’t seen her. The heavy brocade of her formal robes blended in with the rest of the crowd, but upright at her full height, Irella towered over everyone nearby. She resisted the sudden urge to slouch.

“I'm sorry, I don't,” he answered.

Her nostrils flared in irritation, but she forced herself to sound pleasant. It wasn't the novice's fault her world was coming apart at the seams. “Very well. How are your studies progressing?”

As they moved through the crowd, she let him boast about how intuitive he found the golden ratio and load resistance equations and forced herself not to resent his ease and proficiency with the numbers—and his doubtless clean hand at drafting. Having come late to the training, she'd struggled with the maths taught during the novitiate period; if she hadn't been touched by the divine and protected by Eramepi, her tutors in the Temple no doubt would have suceeded in casting her out. 

The novice fell silent as they entered en-Avestur's orbit. Irella's stomach sank as she saw the High Priestess of the Engineer, nin-Kritanna, tucked into his shadow. Two *biladiyn* she didn't recognize flanked them. Alem took up a position at the point of their defensive triangle. 

It wasn't a surprise to see nin-Kritanna and en-Avestur together. Despite her own personal frustration with the Engineer's priests, the Gardener, Architect and Engineer were natural allies in internecine quagmire of religious politics; their half of the pantheon accounted for the tangible miracles, while their counterparts in the Temples of the Archivist, the Judge, and the Counselor held sway over the softer, more indirect powers. 

“The death of a ruler is an unsettled time, nin-Irella," en-Avestur said, sincerity and sympathy embedded in every word. "I know you were close with Eramepi, and I know that you join me in being devoted to the unity and stability of the city-states under Architect's aegis.”

Irella aborted the hot defense of her decision to repair the market sewers she'd been prepared to make; en-Avestur's unsubtle statement of support for Valentia's ascension threw her off-center. She blinked once to reorient herself and said, cautiously, “It has always been my honor to preserve the League, which is why I have worked so hard to—”

Irritation flashed in en-Avestur's jade-green eyes, breaking the illusion of compassion. “Spare me, nin-Irella. I don’t want to hear a priestess who barely struggled her way through her political history studies try to explain why she knows better than I how to carry out the Architect’s will.”

Irella bit back a sharp retort. With Eramepi gone, she had no patron to protect her if the High Priest decided to put her in what he thought should be her place. None save Wanishtu, but he wasn't offering political protection—he was trying to give her a place to flee. 

She wasn't going to run away from everything she'd worked to build. Irella stiffened her spine as she held Avestur’s gaze with as much dignity as she could muster.

Avestur would never respect her if she groveled and now, more than ever, she needed his respect. 

After a moment's impasse, he softened. “Your devotion to Eramepi was noted, nin-Irella, but he did you no favors by stationing you here in the capital.”

Since Eramepi had placed her in the capitol specifically to counteract the Temple’s streak of elitism, Irella didn’t argue. Let Avestur think her appointment had been meant as a reward for her support. “It is my duty to serve.”

He flashed her a thin smile. “Well. Serve you shall. But I think it’s time we end the farce that you’re at all suited to urban duties, don’t you?”

Irella froze, her eyes flicking toward nin-Kritanna and then back. 

"Since you prefer not to my follow my orders, perhaps you'll listen to reason when there's an army backing the request.” His eyes turned to ice.  This was to be his answer, then, to her confrontation with en-Tirigan in the market. He wouldn't have involved nin-Kritanna otherwise. “General Lupicin has requested thaumaturgical support for the garrison in Uskune."

“Uskune,” Irella repeated dully, unprepared for the memories that roared back at the thought of returning to the mining town. Uskune. So many things had happened to her in Uskune. Raiders had killed her parents in Uskune. She’d been taken by slavers in Uskune. It was a dark, dank city barely deserving of the name; the only Lysarian city actually situated in the foothills of the Voldshee Mountains.

Eramepi had elevated it to the status of a city-state solely as a counter to Keldehss. She couldn’t imagine that en-Avestur truly cared about preserving the League’s control over its mines. Arable land was limited and the region was only barely civilized by Lysarian standards. 

"You've expressed interest in working in younger cities than Oruku, and our work to raise Temples has been slow-going. My proxies there have requested a budget larger than would be wise for us to allocate under the circumstances. Your presence would therefore serve a dual purpose.” Satisfaction creased Avestur’s cheeks as he relaxed his weight. “It will be good for us to extend our influence and show the people there the fullness of what the Architect has to offer; it’s past time we started expanding beyond the valleys.”

The acid roiling in her stomach leapt into her throat. She’d embraced Lysaria's riparian lifestyle wholeheartedly, hadn’t stepped foot in the Voldshee mountains since childhood, but there was still a part of her that had always found the idea of spreading the Lysarian way of life into the mountains viscerally wrong. It was one thing to unite the cities along the Lysar; they spoke the same language, worshipped the same gods, ate the same foods and were led by the same bloodlines. For the Temples to spread into the Voldshee mountains would mean more than conquest—it would spell the destruction of everything her people *were*.

She didn't see a way to object, except — “Is that something we’re in a position to do, with Eramepi dead?” She hadn't even seen Eramepi's body, and Avestur was already trying to send her as far into the barbarian frontier as he could and still claim authority over her connection with the divine.

Avestur nodded. “Our new Sovereign has asked us to grant the request. A Monche trading caravan is on its way to the city, and with Eramepi dead, there’s a chance the nomads won’t honor their contracts. Valentia is concerned about the integrity of the northern border in these uncertain times, and we believe she has reason to be.”

Of course. Either she’d expand his sphere of influence substantially and raise the profile of his Temple by fortifying Uskune, or she’d die trying.  From his perspective it was probably a win-win. 

The betrayal felt as sharp as a stiletto under her ribs although in truth, she should have expected it. As Eramepi’s sister and closest advisor, Valentia had spent most of the last decade trying to convince Eramepi that Irella was a danger to his rule. Although she had never publicly doubted Irella’s loyalty, she’d hated the idea of inducting a barbarian child into a Lysarian priesthood and had railed against the optics of using a barbarian-born thaumaturge to break the siege at Marna. 

*I know she’s powerful, Eramepi, and that’s useful I’ll agree, but half your generals look at her and see a Voldshee witch smashing their homes, not a Lysarian prince uniting our people.*

It hadn’t mattered, before, when Eramepi was alive to overrule her, but if the dream of a united—and more importantly, peaceful—Lysaria was to live on, Irella needed to make Valentia finally understand that there was more to ruling a fractious pack of competing factions than getting them to like you. 

She spun her gaze around the room, looking for the Sovereign. To buy time, she asked. “What does the general want me to do?” 

Avestur smiled a tigerfish smile. “Ensure the safety of the city, of course." 

Irella finally spotted Valentia in the crowd. Lysaria's new sovereign stood resplendent in violet robes trimmed in ermine, one of Eramepi’s generals at her elbow as she smiled at a minister from the treasury. She met Irella's gaze and then deliberately looked away; an unmistakable snub. 

Fury sunk its fists into her gut at the snub. 

Irella had abandoned her clan and left behind the safety of the Temple of the Architect in Marna to fight beside Eramepi in the Unification War, a war that had placed Valentia in the most powerful seat in Lysaria. If not for Irella, and Architectural miracles she had wrought, Valentia would be bound in silks to Sargov of Keldehss, wed to a cold and brutish prince bent on grinding her home into subordinate status as a satellite state. 

"I'm not going anywhere until the funerary rights are complete," Irella said flatly. Valentia could ignore her, but she wouldn't dare turn away Wanishtu, and the governor's son would be happy to carry a message for her, she was sure. He might even be able to convince Valentia to read it. 

As though he could sense her thoughts, Avestur said, "You're going to obey your lawful superiors, nin-Irella. It you in a terrible position with the other Temples when you ignore my authority in my own sphere. You are a Priestess of the Architect, not an officer in the armies or a noble or a trader under contract. Your Sovereign isn't going to override me, and I don't know why she would want to—what I'm asking you to do is quite reasonable."

Irella's fingernails dug into the skin of her palm. "But Eramepi asked me to renovate the—"

"Eramepi is dead, Irella." His words were flat. "Unfortunately, that means we have bigger concerns than the state of the streets and the sewers."

Oruku was bursting at the seams with people — some even coming all the way from western Nahria, riparian city-states along the Lysar's sister river. The population flocking to the League's new capitol was too much for such an antiquated city, and no one cared because Valentia was a hair's breadth from losing control of Lysaria. Even Irella could understand that the risk of civil war was more important than a barbarian's warning of possible plague, but Eramepi hadn't lost his life in battle. He'd died of fever — fever that would spread through the city as easily as it spread from the swamps if no one fixed the sewers. 

Sanitation wasn't glorious, but it saved lives. If she'd been with Eramepi, she might have been able to save *his* life. 

Irella let out a breath. This wasn't her problem to solve anymore. She was the Architect's thaumaturge, not His High Priestess. High Priests channeled the gods' will, not their power. She was a barbarian without a patron, and Valentia had been right, all those years ago. The bureaucrats from the Treasury had seen her as nothing but Eramepi's Voldshee witch, and though Valentia hadn't come right out and said it, her mere presence was making it harder for Eramepi's sister to take up the mantle of her rule. 

The best thing Irella could do for her was leave. 

"Fine," Irella said. "I'll go to Uskune and help Lupicin overawe the nomads. But you know, en-Avestur, you know that dirty rivers spread disease. Shoddy houses burn. The League can't ignore everything that civilization stands for in the pursuit of coin. That's what forced Eramepi's hand in the first place." 

For the first time, Avestur's eyes went cold. "Make something worthy of Uskune, and maybe I will let you discuss what it means to be civilized. But make no mistake: we need trade more than we need the Lysar to run clear or the peasants to have new houses." 

It was high summer. The tides would shift shortly after dawn, and the Lysar would rise, lifting Eramepi’s spirit to the heavens. 

He wasn't even letting her stay that long.

Though the moon had risen by the time Irella made her way to the docks, Wanishtu was still in his office. He wore the travel gear of a trader, worry crinkling the corners of his eyes until he saw her. The relief was temporary. His boyish grin faltered at her expression. "What happened?"

"They're sending me to Uskune." 

Wanishtu lowered his voice. "You should come with me back home to Marna." 

"As much as I'd appreciate the company, I don't think stopping in every port is the most efficient way to travel." 

Heedless of her *biladiyn* guard, Wanishtu reached out and squeezed her wrist. "That's not what I mean, Irella. We need you." 

“I think Valentia wants me to go to Uskune.” Irella's heart pounded. No one had touched her, actually touched her, skin to skin, in seasons. She couldn't believe it had taken the possibility of civil war to prompt it. “There’s a Monche caravan arriving soon, and Avestur wants me to make Uskune impressive enough keep the nomads from raiding at the borders. Lysaria can't afford that sort of pressure, not while the succession is still so new.” 

Wanishtu's expression tilted sideways as he let out a little laugh. “You know? Eramepi asked us to support the trade fair. I’ve got half the family fortune tied up in caravan goods. And I still think you should stop and talk to my father before you go on to Uskune.”  

He didn't release her hand until she'd promised.
