The sea southwest of the Isle of [[Maehlorn]] and south of the cities of [[Oena]] and [[Alliju]]. It is relatively warm (55Â°F at his deepest, coldest point). It is nearly landlocked, although the island chains on the southeastern side do not create a true barrier. Being nearly landlocked affects conditions in the sea: for instance, tides are very limited as a result of the narrow connection with the nearby oceans. The sea is characterized and immediately recognized by its deep blue color.

It provides routes for trade, colonization, and war, as well as food (from fishing and the gathering of other seafood).

### Inspiration
Mediterranean Sea.

### Name
Related to the word for "central" in Arabic.
