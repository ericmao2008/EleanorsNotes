A blue-blooded species of winged, lactating egglayers who were brought to [[Eheu Isle]] by [[The Realmwalker]]. They are very much not "humans with wings like angel pictures."  Think huge wingspan, wonky ribs, hollow bones, different muscle-to-fat ratio, hardcore leg muscles (and probably shorter legs, proportionally) for launching into the air, designed like a six-limbed creature (i.e. insect) and not a bird/mammal (they were magically engineered, we can do what we want there lol), air sacs and lungs (like the opposite of ballast, lol)

they are [[animals that sleep unihemispherically]] like dolphins and birds. they have to land every week or so to do things on land, but generally I picture it sort of like they sleep face down with their butts in the air and wings on top. Like a cross between a toddler and a quail üòÇ

Culturally common names: [[Mahiai]] (Farmer) Kaman (Carpenter), [[Tusiata]] (poet), Kaipo (the sweetheart), Kamalani (Sky Child) 

Women are relatively scarce due to skewed birthrates and complications with childbirth. On [[Eheu Isle]] this leads to high-status males having successive wives. In [[Tulpitown]] polyandry is more common, with one woman having several husbands (see also: [[circumstances that lead to polyandry]])

Culturally, beads play an important role in their clothing choices: 

> Healani helped fit her into the beaded white leather gowns tradition demanded of a bride. Its skirt was looser than anything she‚Äôd ever worn. Perhaps, if this was a wedding she wanted, she would have felt daring and beautiful. ‚ÄúI feel so exposed,‚Äù Kala whispered. 
> Mahiai was resplendent in a bone-beaded white tunic thin enough ‚Äî and tight enough ‚Äî to display the muscular definition of his arms. 
> Kala finished securing her last bone bead into her crownfeathers. ‚ÄúKirken will do a good job with the ceremony.‚Äù
