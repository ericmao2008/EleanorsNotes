A parallel realm accessible from Verraine. It is the homeland of [[The Realmwalker]] and inhabited by a series of non-humanoid creatures. 

The old story [[crystal magic]] takes place there, #fic/storyStem but it's the homeland of the [[Eheuian]] people, along with my own take on mermaids / centaurs / tailed peoples / clawed people / etc. 

This is also where the women from [[alien death cult]] are from.
