A river that runs through the [[Midire Desert]].

[[Lake Tsiya]] is one of its major sources. The other is [[Lake Osphir]]. Its mouth pours into the [[Wasatean Sea]].

The city of [[Oena]] controls the delta region. The agricultural efforts of the Temple of Tef impact the river near Lake Tsiya.

> Though little rain falls in deserts, deserts receive runoff from ephemeral, or short-lived, streams fed by rain and snow from adjacent highlands. These streams fill the channel with a slurry of mud and commonly transport considerable quantities of sediment for a day or two. Although most deserts are in basins with closed, or interior drainage, a few deserts are crossed by 'exotic' rivers that derive their water from outside the desert. Such rivers infiltrate soils and evaporate large amounts of water on their journeys through the deserts, but their volumes are such that they maintain their continuity. The Nile, the Colorado, and the Yellow are exotic rivers that flow through deserts to deliver their sediments to the sea.
