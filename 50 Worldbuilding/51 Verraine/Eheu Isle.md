Pine nuts, [[tulpi]] herders, terracing in some of the valleys (they're not exclusive to Inca. [[Newsletter Ideas]] â€” terrace agriculture). 

 is primarily comprised of extremely high alpine mountains and some shallow valleys where not much but pines and scrubgrass grow, divide the year between the snowy season and the dry season, with the Typhoon Equinox and the Dry Solstice as the rough time when the seasons shift. The terrain is pretty harsh, but most natural disasters tend to be of the "uncooperative weather" variety (extra-bad blizzards or dry seasons) not the "earthquake/tornado" variety.

The pine trees of Eheu Isle give off incredible clouds of pollen, which is what the [[tulpi]] eat.
