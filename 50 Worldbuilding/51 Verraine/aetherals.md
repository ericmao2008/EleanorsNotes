magic crystals made out of mage blood that can be used to passively pull power from the aether and refine it at a very slow rate. Originated in [[Eheu Isle]], the winged inhabitants were taught by a Realmwalker because they were meant to create a stockpile for him to use. 

They're bought in the [[Arais Delta]] and used to fuel the enchantment magic common in Arais. 

It's also what was used to build the tower in [[Temple Mage]].
