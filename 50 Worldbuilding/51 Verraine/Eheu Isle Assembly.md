The typhoon equinox festival/assembly can't possibly have everybody there; somebody has to watch the herds. So it happens during the mostly-dormant time when the herds don't need a lot of active interaction. After mating, culling, shearing, etc, it's mostly just milking that needs to be maintained. So pregnant women and their husbands and young children stay behind with other people who can't handle the arduous travel, such as those too young or too old or too injured to fly far.
