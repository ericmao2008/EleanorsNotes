winged whale-like goats that eat pine pollen that drifts on the wind, will break ice like a horse to get to water, definitely mammals to survive in such a cold place (NOT dragons), named based on [Tulpar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpar) from Central Asian mythology. Susceptible to a disease that makes them sweat blood (parasites give them sores), inspired by the [Tianma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianma) of Chinese mythology, which is itself often confused by the [Ferghana horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferghana_horse). Not native to Verraine. They were imported to [[Eheu Isle]]. [[Kala]] steals some to take to [[Voldshee]] mountains to trade. 

The Eheu Pine trees give off enormous clouds of pollen, which is what the tulpi eat. At the elevations and latitutde they inhabit there's not much in the way of seasons, but when snow falls the pollen is forced to the earth so the tulpi have to land and dig through the snow and drink a lot of snow to get sustenance, and their herders are similarly "grounded." 

See Also: this discussion about [mountain goats vs sheep](https://www.summitdaily.com/news/two-competing-species-mountain-goat-v-bighorn-sheep/) which discusses why the mountain goats are hardier; they're less specialized, more generalist, and less prone to disease. Tulpi are probably *very* specialist.
