## The Architect
God of CITIES. 
He is the patron of medicine (healers, doctors, paramedics) and urban planning (builders and infrastructure). Mages trained in his Temple focus on one of two tracks: healing wounds and creating infrastructure.

Priests include: [[Avestur]] and [[60 Characters/b. ATA 100-199/Irella]]. 

### Precepts

* "triangles are stronger than squares" -- not only true from a bridge-building perspective, but related to the philosophical idea that a group of three is ideal, any more than that involved in decision making is too many (reference Heinlein and his definition of a committee as an organism with more than six legs and no brain).
