A fungus developed during the Salted Wars, rorgoten spreads easily thanks to its aggressive mycelium and tenacious spores. It has an incredibly strong stench, and is attracted to signs of human habitation like woodsmoke, split timber, tilled soil, and sewage. 

It excretes enzymes that break down organic matter. It is inedible in the same way plastic is (i.e. it's not impossible but most things aren't evolved to break it down), 

It was first developed by mages (sorry "priests") working with the [[Cult of Valor]] as a siege weapon to subdue a populace because only they knew how to remove it, but got out of control. By the end of the [[Salted Wars]], when the branch of the [[Cult of Valor]] on the eastern continent was wiped out by [[Surzi]] during the events of [[2021.10.13 Shattered (MF)]], it had spread as far north as the [[Mestanese Mountains]], gotten a foothold in the [[Arais Delta]], and was often found in pockets west of the aetherglass desert.
