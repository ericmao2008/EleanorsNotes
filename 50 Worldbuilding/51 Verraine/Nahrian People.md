The culture of the [[Nahrian Basin]] spans both the eastern ([[Lysaria]]) and western regions of the two rivers region, northwest and northeast of the [[Arais Delta]]. Because the geography is so similar, many cultural traditions are shared, but the separation between them from the [[Monche Nomads]] and the [[Voldshee]].

### People

The people tend to be smaller than the [[Voldshee]] (although larger than the [[Monche Prairie]]),  and also more “civilized.” The populations in Nahria are much denser as even the farms are typically large plantation-style affairs, especially in the lowlands near the rivers. 

Nahrian slavery is economically-based and has to do with debtor relationships primarily, although it can evolve out of prisoner-of-war situations.
