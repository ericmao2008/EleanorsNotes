# Overview

In Verraine magic functions as an extra "physics" layer (like how light photons and air molecules exist in the same space) akin to the electromagnetic spectrum that only some people can sense and fewer can use; "auras" happen when those bits of magic collect (vaguely like in His Dark Materials I guess) around a person; individual power and ability is determined by the density of the power in the aura.

The timeline follows the "technological" advances of utilizing magic. Magic is essentially a raw energy source that can be manipulated by mages.

During the beginnings of civilization, a lot of the on-stage magic is stuff like building dams and canals and carving roads, food preservation via drying and freezing, purifying water, etc. Different "traditions" teach magic different ways; culture plays a strong role in how magic can be utilized, and most mages need to be taught magic, which intrinsically restricts their ability to use it. Young mages are much more malleable and flexible, but their lack of knowledge also limits them. It takes an extraordinarily strong person to pioneer a new school of magic.

Magic can be moved once it's been condensed within a mage's "range" which varies by strength levels.

Though most mages don't drain their aura all the way down, if they do there's pain / passing out involved. But yeah they have to wait for it to recharge; no remedy but time as they say.

There is a max cap on auras; violet is as much as can get packed into that space so there's no "theoretically a single mage could blow up the earth by drilling to the core in 5 minutes while simultaneously shielding themselves from the heat" there's a lot of "figuring out how to use it" involved throughout the books as human understanding evolves right now I'm thinking they can mostly (1) create shield of varying types of permeability, (2) alter temperatures (3) move things (well not just fire, but general temperature control; they can also dry things out, make things cold, etc)

Some few have figured out basic transmutation.

There are obviously going to be military applications so I need to think thru the tactics: expect (1) targeted use of fire and temperature control (2) physical shielding (3) use of targeted kinetic energy to kill or maim.

## raka

The actual magic "power" is known as "raka" and functions similarly to mana to the Islamic concept of barakah. The physics equivalent would be photons.

All mages have an aura, and all auras are approximately an inch thick. Mages naturally condense the natural magic in the environment into their auras, the density of which is dependent on their resonance. Auras take time to regenerate, approximately a day from empty to full. Having a completely empty aura is excruciatingly painful for a mage and can cause unconsciousness, because exposing the "core" of a mage to unfiltered magic without the protection of the aura is damaging. This is also why one mage trying to "use" another mage's power is painful (although less so); mages are calibrated to a particular resonance.

Magic is measured on a color scale, red through violet like rainbows -- children whose auras resonate at higher frequencies (like at the violet level) are more powerful, able to do more complex tasks quicker. While someone who resonates at red can do most of what a green mage can, it will take them longer, and there are some things that the amount of power a red mage would have to pump into a spell would make it collapse like a house of cards.

This is followed by manifestations of power, for instance creating a shovel or rope or net of force. Manifestations always, where applicable, bear the color of the power being used to create it. A smaller net (or whatever) is typically easier to create, for it is less complex, but at a certain level of smallness, such as nuances too small for the eye to see, the opposite is true.

These basic manifestations are not spells in the truest sense, for they are consciously controlled from beginning to end and require the step-by-step manipulation of the witch. True spells are much more difficult.

It is much trickier -- but also necessary, for higher-level magic -- to add complex sequences, triggers, and timers to spells. Things like shields, which respond to intrusion or relax when recognizing a permitted individual, are a constant but unconscious drain on the caster, but must be carefully structured.

Transmutation is energy intensive and easier for some materials than others, dependent on the energy requirements; i.e. turning air into "a solid" is easy because of the atomic numbers and bonds in question, but creating silver (in specific) is much harder.

Even more difficult are enchantments, spells that possess a reservoir of power rather than pulling from their caster. Enchantments can be designed for use by individuals other than the caster, and can be powered the same way. Enchantments are the pinnacle of craft.

Unlike gifts, there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to what can be done with craft. Manifestations, spells, and enchantments can be done by anyone, but there is a flexible, sliding scale of potential that also takes into account skill. A skilled red witch could probably, with time and a large enough canvas, enchant a stick that can channel power to spew fire. But a skilled green witch could do this with a small pebble, and might produce different patterns with the fire depending on time of day, or something complex along those lines.

The general rule to keep in mind is that the factors involved in craft are (1) complexity of the magic (2) source and resonance of the power (3) skill of the caster (4) type of magic.

This magic system is based loosely on the electromagnetic spectrum and maps to the idea of "waves" and electricity.

### Civil Mage
	
> Does that mean that her entire power is conjuring up aetherock out of nothingness? That seems good for story purposes - both very useful and very limited. Is she limited to simple shapes, or whatever she can concentrate on?

Essentially yes. I'm not sure I'm articulating this using words other people will understand (my husband, who has done a lot to help me with the physics of magic system, would doubtless roll his eyes), but she's essentially limited to what she's able to visualize as a single object, and is limited in size by what is physically able to support itself. Like, she could create a bridge with supports the size of toothpicks and a deck thicker than a car, but it would promptly collapse and waste a lot of magic. So in a lot of ways a mage like Arminia is limited by their own intelligence and mastery of physics, materials science, etc.

Mages from other Temples spend their training period mastering things like food preservation (magic cuisinarts / aetherock spheres filled with vacuum... probably, to be honest I haven't dug much into it because it's not necessary for the book yet, and might not ever be relevant to the plot, although some elements will come up in later books in the series) and truth saying (mental magic is a whole other ball of wax that takes a whole other training path but essentially leverages the same sorts of science as modern cyborgs and how it's actually possible to type with your brain these days). It is possible for mages to learn more than one school of magic, as will become evident in Act II, but it's difficult, time consuming, not usually worth it, and requires finding someone willing to train you.

Anyway, aetherock loosely based off of aerogels in that it's naturally quite brittle, so in addition stuff like load calculations she's needed to master a bit of materials science so that the "webbing" that gives it resilience is properly distributed.

That's a bit in the weeds, but I intend to get more into detail about that once she gets time to sit down and really plan something, which should be sometime in chapter 06.
