The elite military forces of [[Edarebia]] (on the eastern continent). They’re basically werewolves, created by mages. They have sharp eyes and are very agile and fast. They carry 2ft swords and have inch-long talons. They have a pack/alpha structure. 

They can go “feral” when they meet a woman with the right genetics to bear their children, which is rare (and substitutes for the whole “fated mate” thing). Most Swordwulfen are told they can’t sire children. 

They exist by bonding a wolf aether-spirit (created out of magic) with a human. The wolves can be magically bound to the swords and in that form can be used by mages as protection.
