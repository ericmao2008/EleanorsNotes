Modeled on the [[2020.09.07 Tombs|Order of the Holy Sepulchre]]. A religious order (not a Temple) in [[Nahrian Basin]] devoted to the protection of [[thaumaturge|thaumaturges]]. The [[biladiyn]] are the "front-line" agents, but the Order itself is a bureaucracy with childcare, financial agents, etc. 

The order was founded as a direct result of the events in [[2022.04.27 The Apothecary's Daughter (MF)]] â€” the protagonist was murdered after the miraculous healing of the Prince of [[Pontero]]. Her brother, one of the Prince's bodyguards, was the first *biladiyn.*

Inspired by the excarnation in Zoroastrian (an ancient [[Persian]] religion) funerary practices; a dakhma (aka [Tower of Silence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Silence), aka astudan) is a circular, raised structure used for exposing corpses to the elements and scavengers in order to strip the flesh from the bones for later entombment in an [ossuary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossuary). This method is typically used when burial space is scarce.
