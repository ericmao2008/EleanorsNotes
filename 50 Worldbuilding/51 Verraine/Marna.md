The northernmost city (and northernmost port) on the [[Lysar River]] in [[Lysaria]].

### Siege of Marna

The Siege of Marna was the military event that incited the Unification War, where [[Eramepi]] of Marna conquered the eastern Nahrian city-states and founded the [[Lysaria|Lysarian League]]. The siege began when the ruler of [[Keldehss]], [[Sargov]], attacked in retribution for a variety of escalating slights, including the refusal of his marriage offer for Estein’s sister [[Valentia]]. Of equal concern was Estein’s recent creation of the mining outpost in [[Uskune]], which Sargov viewed as an expansionist threat and also an insult as it allowed Marna to threaten Keldehss' dominance of the metals trade. 

Sargov launched his attack approximately a [[units of measure|decan]] after en-[[Jorian]], the Marnan Temple of [[The Architect]]’s only [[thaumaturge]], died of liver failure. He was unaware that three years before, when visiting Uskune, Eramepi rescued [[60 Characters/b. ATA 100-199/Irella]] from indentured servitude at the behest of a Counselor-mage, who directed that she be placed in the service of the Architect. Irella had almost finished her training when Sargov attacked. 

Sagrov’s army included a mage from the Temple of the Gardener and two medmages from the Temple of the Architect, but the mage from the [[The Engineer|Engineering Temple]] was most puissant. Eramepi, by contrast, held Irella, a single medmage, and a [[The Counselor|Counselor]]. However, defenders have an advantage in a siege and the city was extraordinarily well-provisioned due to the mundane efforts of the Temple of [[The Gardener]] and [[Valentia]]'s exceptional skills at logistics.
