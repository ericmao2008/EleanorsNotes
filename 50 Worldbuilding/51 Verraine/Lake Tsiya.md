Lake Tana

### Dam

A large dam built by the leadership of the [[Temple of Tef]] at [[Lake Tsiya]] where it flows into [[Aakari River]] in order to help stabilize the fishing industry in Lake Tsiya and assist the expanding agriculture of the region. 

It has a major impact on the ''anadromous fish'' (e.g. upriver spawning, like salmon) fish -- since the real Nile doesn't have any, this would be a great time for the [[moonfish]] to become relevant... as well as downriver settlements like [[Senna's Ford]].

"The forest on the floodplain of Kenya's Tana River appears to be slowly dying out as it loses its ability to regenerate because of the reduction in high floods due to a series of dams upstream. 

The 6,000 square kilometre floodplain of the Kafue River in Zambia, known as the Kafue Flats, was once one of the richest wildlife habitats in the world. The Kafue, a main tributary of the Zambezi, was impounded in the 1970s by the Gorge Dam which permanently flooded much of the Flats and then by the Itezhitezhi Dam upstream, which eradicated the seasonal floods over the remaining part of the plain. Biologist Walter A. Sheppe visited the flats before and after the dams. On his first visit in May 1967, 'the extensive annual floods were largely hidden by a dense growth of emergent grasses reaching to the horizon.' Large herds of antelope grazed the edges of the flooded area and zebra and wildebeest fed on the higher ground. The water and shore were dense with birds. Sixteen years later Sheppe returned to the same spot. This time the lowest part of the plain was covered by Gorge Reservoir and the rest was dry. The productive grasses that had depended on the seasonal floods had been replaced by aquatic plants on the open water, and on the dry former floodplain by a sparse cover of low grasses and scrub. There were few birds, relatively few antelope, and no zebra or wildebeest." -- [https://www.internationalrivers.org/hydrological-effects-of-dams Excerpted from Silenced Rivers: The Ecology and Politics of Large Dams by Patrick McCully].

Silt transport and nitrogen transport are important nutrient flows.

Pulsing and flooding has consequences for the changes in the channel (invasion of the channel by vegetation and canyon mass wasting).

Changes in flow rate has serious consequences for water temperature and hence water oxygenation (witness the big fish dieoffs when farming was preferred over river health).

While the dam is filling, often over a span of years, the river downstream is depleted, for the same span of years.

After the dam is filled, there will be less water downstream in the river because it is being used by humans elsewhere.

Flooding and hydrological pulsing are curtailed or eliminated. 

Silt transport is interrupted downriver, as the silt is being dumped behind the dam. 

Nitrogen transport, upriver in the form of spawning fish, is interrupted.

##### From Gregoy Beacher 

The new Millennium Dam on the Blue Nile was envisioned but not really thought possible as recently as 2000. It presents many questions and difficulties. Ethiopia is a relatively poor country but possessing of a vast amount of hydropower potential. Most of the flow of the nile come from the Blue Nile and only a small flow comes from the White Nile originating in Uganda. As I’m sure you are aware, the two tributaries of the Nile meet in ''Khartoum, downstream of Ethiopia.''

The Egyptian government is not pleased with the prospect of any interference with the flow of the Nile into it’s land. The river is transcendental to Egyptian civilization. So far there have been only diplomatic protests. During Nassar’s times the Egyptians flew sorties of MIGS up the river and over Addis to display their displeasure. At the time, the Eisenhower administration through John Foster Dulles was threatening to fund an earlier version of what is now the Millennium Dam ...

Most of the question you ask have to do with environmental issues, which are important. Dams provide may economic and environment (e.g., alternative and renewable energy) benefits, but they also have huge impact on the flora and fauna of rivers. You may want to check out “International Rivers”, they are a highly partisan environmental group which agitates against dams. But not all of what they say is foolish, only maybe half. They can provide you with information on things like fish passages, sediment management, etc. The attached might be useful on environmental impacts ...

The main issues with the Millennium Dam are not environmental, they are political and have to do with water supply to Egypt. The issues go back to Pharaonic times, but came to a head during the British period (1880± to WWII). The really great reference on the hydrology of the Nile is Hurst, H. E. (1952, 1957 2nd enlarged edn) The Nile. Constable, London. It’s widely available in used copies at libraries or places like Amazon. Most of the environmental issues with the Nile were sealed with the building of the High Dam in Egypt in 1960-70. This cut off the annual inundation of Lower Egypt and the annual sediment deposition. The new Millennium Dam will not affect those impacts which have mostly already happened. Ditto, the Nile has never had many (if any, as far as I am aware) ''anadromous fish''. This is a classical paper …
