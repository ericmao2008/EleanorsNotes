These large spiders produce [[how spidersilk is harvested]] (note: all spiders create silk) and feed on thorn tree thorns (Beltain bodies) in acacia shrubs like [[Bagheera kiplingi]]

Native to the [[Monche Prairie]]; the [[Monche Nomads]] have domesticated them. In addition to producing silk, they are eaten as a source of meat. (see also: [[Spider Kebab Correspondence]]). 

## Naming

Name inspired by the Yangshao (the Neolithic culture responsible for the production of silk) combined with the scientific name of the only vegetarian spider: [[Bagheera kiplingi]].
