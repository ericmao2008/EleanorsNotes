### Landscape

The Voldshee Mountains have eight peaks; the people of the  regions tell a tale of how the Isle was formed when an heroic ship’s captain turned a monstrous, attacking squid to stone in order to protect his ship. Each of the peaks represents one of the cephalopod’s arms, reaching up to grasp the ancient ship.

The Voldshee forests are dominated by barrow trees, which are hardwoods that produce both fruits and nuts in abundance. They grow straight and tall, with thick branches at 90° angles that interlace to form a sturdy canopy every ten feet or so. The seeds of these trees are planted in the chest cavity of corpses and the trees bear fruit and grow productively for as many years as their host’s lifespan. They are highly useful trees; they can be tapped to harvest a rubber-like sap, the pollen is a powerful antibiotic painkiller, the nuts are high in protein and the fruits are easily preserved and high-energy. The leaves serve well as insulation and the roots can be brewed to make a caffeinated drink. The flowers can be dried and smoked to create a mildly euphoric, hallucinogenic effect.

Before the Unification of [[Maehlorn]], the Voldshee people lived in scattered clans. 

### Culture

The Voldshee clans live in the  of form small settlements rather than urban areas. Clan houses and farmsteads are scattered across the landscape. 

The people of the Voldshee mountains live mostly in clan steads. They practice some limited farming, but focus more on hunting, forestry and herding. They trade primarily in timber, furs, and medicines. They are superstitiously opposed to mining due to their religious beliefs about subterranean peoples, but are able to exploit surface-level rsources exposed by erosion, e.g. coal, saltpetre and various metals.

The Voldshee practice an honor-based prisoner-of-war system that bears a strong resemblance to fosterage/apprenticeship but still translates as slavery.

The diet is rich in protein and the beverages are caffeinated tea and pomace brandy.

The belief structures of the Voldshee are highly cyclical and seasonal, with an emphasis on death and rebirth. Although the Voldshee do not worship gods as such, they do believe in a death deity of sorts.

* Of the "major characters," one of my protagonist's ([[Irella]]) parental figures is nonbinary. The exact relationship is hard to define in a tweet, but the society of her birth ([[Voldshee]]) is very accepting of genderfluidity and children are generally raised by triads as the nuclear household. [This is canon because I tweeted it](https://twitter.com/EleanorKonik/status/1474140795330564099). 

#### Religion 

The Voldshee believe that there is a race of subterranean vampires that dwell in the bones of the mountains. Their king is a powerful necromancer, and his wives are ethereal elementals; this race has relatively extreme sexual dimorphism and practices polygamy. The king is known as Death, his wives are Winter and Summer. The tribes celebrate the equinoxes as a time of balance and family harmony; the solstices by contrast are times of life/plenty and fallow/remembrance/death. The equinox festivals have heavy overtones of invitation; it is believed that during the cold season, Winter is spending time in the World Above out of pique, getting time away from her lovers, and vice versa.

There is a folktale that says the first equinox was a time when Death created a bargain with the Voldshee, emerging from his home in the Mountain Bones to give the Voldshee the first barrow tree seed in exchange for a promise that the blood of the Voldshee is for his use. This is seen as a symbiotic relationship, and the source of the Voldshee’s elemental/death themed channeling magic.
