Nichtdonts are armoured, armadillo-like creatures native to the [[Broncall River]], although they've been taken to the [[Mestanese Mountains]], where they do quite well in the muddy artificial swamps created by draining the lakes.  They occupy a similar ecological niche to armadillos,  amphibious turtles and hippos ( #fic/expandWorldbuilding -- how does that work?) . They underwent [[domestication]] like cattle, and their scutes ('dillo scales, basically) are prone to fungal infections. Some breeds have been bred to increase the natural levels of capsaicin, creating a waxy coating on their scales, which acts to fight these fungal infections.

These hard, waxy coatings are scraped off once a year to prevent stiffness and inability to move (like modern sheep).  This wax is prized as a preservative, for its uses as a flavoring, and as its use as sealing wax, for wax tablets for children, waxcloth, etc. It's also a critical component in [[silk was used as a measure of value#13 01 rAskHistorians r AskHistorians thread https www reddit com r AskHistorians comments knl41q why_was_that_the_greeks_and_romans_of_antiquity about paintings in classical antiquity|encaustic paintings]]. 

However, nichtdonts with such "burning" skin prefer to wallow in the marshy, muddy areas, leading to the artificial creation of ponds by nichtdonts ranchers. Even wild nichtdonts enjoying wallowing for the same reasons as hippos.

Ranchers must wear specialty gear in order to avoid burns, but since nichtdonts wax is extremely valuable, they find it worth it -- unless they're part of the unfortunate percentage of the population with an extreme sensitivity to capsaicin.

Nichtdonts also shed their scutes, which is used to create scale-mail type leather armor. This molting process is similar to that seen in turtles.
