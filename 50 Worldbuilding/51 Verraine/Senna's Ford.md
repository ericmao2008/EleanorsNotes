Senna's Ford grew organically as a convenient crossing for the [[Imazi]] tribes to cross the [[Aakari River]] that separates either side of the [[Midire Desert]]. Though once it was a bustling town with merchants and markets, since the construction of the [[Jisge]] bridge a few leagues to the north, it has been declining. Now, it is primarily inhabited by fisherfolk and small-scale subsistence farmers. 

It is notable for being the birthplace of [[Kia]]. The Jisge bridge was built after [[Zahle]] came to live in Senna's Ford.
