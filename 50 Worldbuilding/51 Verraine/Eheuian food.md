Eheuains mostly eat insects and birds, but also byproducts like eggs and cheese. They do slaughter tulpi during [Eheuian festivals](https://www.notion.so/Eheuian-festivals-5d0f0fe3cec7442da3090a8c0cac10ab) (similar to how we slaughter lamb and sheep at certain times of year).

They do not have chickens, the tulpi are the only animals they explicitly herd. Tulpi are basically flying whales / mammalian enough to lactate. The eheuians mostly eat insects for the same reasons birds do; they're fliers, and they're extremely opportunistic omnivores.

They spend most of their time flying while the tulpi "graze" on pollen, keeping the tulpi where they ought to be and making sure they stay together and don't fight too much, so the eheuians will sort of also opportunistically graze on "tulpi parasites" that are kinda like barnacles and other parasitic mites and fish that would bother whales. 

If they're landed they might eat stuff from the food stores, hunt marmots, or whatever.
