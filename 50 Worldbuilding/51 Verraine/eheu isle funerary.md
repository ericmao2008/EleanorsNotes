"Flying into the sea" is a euphamism for suicide. It's highly frowned upon by the priesthood, not just because suicide takes a productive worker out, but because their bodies can't fossilize into bluestone for conversion into [[aetherals]]. They "bury" their dead at the edge of the treeline under [[tulpi]] skin shrouds in wooden tombs, due to the difficulty of digging or finding large enough stones for a cairn. The goal is to ensure that wild creatures don't scavenge the corpses and that as much of the body is given time to condense into bluestone as possible.
