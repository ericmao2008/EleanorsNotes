The solar year in [[Verraine]] is about 400 days long. The planet has no moon, but astrologically speaking, a new constellation rises in the east every 10 days, marking the beginning of a **decan**. There are 15 constellations that cycle through, so that the astrological calendar does not perfectly align with the solar calendar. However, most civilizations count **40 decans in a year.**

The **dating system** for Verraine on a meta level counts from the founding of the Temple of [[The Archivist]] and is therefore demarcated as ATA. 

Primitive river valley civilizations like [[Nahrian Basin]] and the people who live along the [[Aakari River]] (like [[Senna's Ford]], see seasons below) divide the year into 10 "months" of 4 decans each. The annual flood typically aligns to the beginning of the first month. Fishing is typically viable until the end of Month 3, when the waters recede and crops are planted. The end of the harvest season is typically at the end of Month 8.
