They're inedible by humans (their only natural predator is the [[snapper]] and secrete antivenin in their scales. I like the idea of their internals functionally liquefying if exposed to air and the subsequent liquid being useful as a purification agent for wells and other potentially compromised water sources (i.e. basically chlorine).

They would, of course, be rare. I can't decide if they should be **crescent-shape** or ball-shaped or some combination of both (e.g. pufferfish).

They can be found in the [[Aakari River]] and the [[Arais Delta]] Delta.
