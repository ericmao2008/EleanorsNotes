Every year, all the boys born that year go off to serve the priesthood for the summer. Then at the end of the summer, they get traded to a new tribe/village. 

The boys get traded around the tribes every festival, like a draft. Every boy camps out with a representative from the village as an overseer for the summer and does work for the priesthood for the good of the whole island like (not building roads; they have wings! something else? repairing fencing for animals? idk what would even make sense here, check against [[age-sets]].) 

Who are the priests? Representatives from the clans that stay with the priesthood for whatever reason. #fic/expandWorldbuilding later. 

At the end of they get drafted into new settlements and have to "make friends" with the girls and find a place in that new village. It happens every years, for boys between ages 15 to 20. They go home during the offseason. The girls get by just fine without them :P
