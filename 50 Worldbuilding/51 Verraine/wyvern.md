A winged snake-like desert creature that fulfills the ecological niche of a snake and desert eagle, two of the predators that do well in the desert. Their primary diet is burrowing rodents. They have a wingspan of about six feet. They are native to the [[Midire Desert]].

Just as a start, and other answers may not have to do this, let's really assert the fact that a wyvern is a large reptile. Disregarding any of its advantages with flight or hunting preferences, we have to establish that it's somewhere warm & sunny.

That's right, these big guys are ectotherms like any other lizard and need to bask in order to regulate their body temperature. They could even spread their wings to radiate excess heat or fold them in to stay warm (I think half a dozen basking wyverns on a beach makes for a good visual). For ideas on how active your wyverns can be, you can look at the Komodo dragon or Marine iguana of the Galapagos. Time spent swimming or flying means a big decrease in body temperature and high energy consumption, so it's doubtful that swimming and flying are things that your wyvern can do for a very long period.

Of course this is a narrow definition of behavior, and not the only one seen in reptilian evolution, but anything you choose or want in terms of behavior and habitat will hinge on your reptile's ability to regulate its body temperature and get enough energy for activity for some time during the day.

If you are big, powerful and mobile you do not need to eat right where you live. You can commute. I am thinking of whales which live and breed up at the top of the water (because they need to breathe!) but dive down and hunt in the abyss, a mile or more below. The wyverns could live up on the mountains and then glide out over the grasslands to hunt. I think a mountain would be fine vantage point from which to scout out likely buffalo or elephants to eat.

Benefits of mountains: no bugs, no nest predators, great visibility. Sweet updrafts for gliding. Less humidity = less wing fungus. Delicious snow to eat.

Re: mountain too cold for lizards - even cold blooded animals are not necessarily endothermic. Both tuna and great white sharks have (different) methods to warm their muscles with metabolic activity. I have read theories that dinosaurs may have had similar methods.

Scenario 2 In our second scenario, wyverns are reptilian, similar to pterosaurs, with venom glands like the spitting cobra, and serrated teeth like a monitor lizard. These wyverns would likely dwell on volcanic islands, diving for large fish, or in rainforests, luring megafauna to its territory by shaking the canopy as it flies by.

Argentavis and pterosaurs seem to provide strong precedent for this big bird.

Argentavis was a scavenger that scouted for carcasses across savannas. It didn't have the easiest time getting into the air, compared to the v-toll of a pigeon.

Pterosaurs are believed to have hunted smaller airbornes and fish, as well as some land creatures, don't forget that they had teeth.

You need open spaces for this to work and a lack of stealthy, threatening creatures. Breathing fire to clear forests or a technique for scaring prey out of cover would be invaluable. The ability to climb or perch would be pretty neat too, helping them survive in diverse climates.

Seaside habitats would help generate the kinds of winds a creature like this would desire, occasionally creating convenient convection currents.
