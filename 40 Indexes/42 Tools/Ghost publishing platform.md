## Ancillary Tools

- [First Promoter](https://firstpromoter.com/) - Affiliate and referral tracking

> You can easily track who top referrers are and manually give rewards to top affiliates with First Promoter. They don't necessarily have features to manage it - but there's nothing to stop you from using it that way.
> 
> I know a couple of people who use FirstPromoter links to track different marketing channels, just so they can see where most signups/conversions are coming from without actually using referrals at all! So there's all sorts of ways to use it
