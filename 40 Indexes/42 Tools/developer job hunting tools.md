- [Invisible Network](https://www.invisiblenetwork.com/), only for software development jobs, is really slick. Fill out some info like describing what would be your ideal job and working environment and they post a list of job seekers that employers can search thru but without identifying details such as name, gender, race, etc, so they have to base their interest without that information about any of the candidates.  Then the company can request an intro with you and it only goes forward if you agree. Perfect for low key, low pressure job searching, and seems to be actual people behind the scenes coordinating
