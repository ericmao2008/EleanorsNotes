Verraine is a fantasy setting for a world where magic is based on the electromagnetic spectrum but can be harnessed in vastly different ways depending on the cultural and technological background of the mage; training and concept exposure impacts the possibilities and by adulthood around age 25 it's exceedingly difficult for mages to change how they use magic. 

The universe that the plane of Verraine inhabits is fractal, rather than planetary, in nature. Some planes are connected along nodes of [[magic]] which create stable stress points in the fabric of the universe. Others exist in isolation, except when unstable stressors act to temporarily create a bridge between planes.
