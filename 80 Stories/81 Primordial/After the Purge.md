* After the Purge precipitated by the Cult of Valor, but before the founding of [[the Collegium of Tal]]
* Evolved into [[2021.10.06 The laundress & the fungal growth (FF)]] but could still use it as part of a chapter for something, it's a different POV.

"Can you do anything?" Mama asked, wringing her hands. 

"Mama, I'm a soldier, not a priest." 

"But—" 

"I could ask someone in the city for help," he continued, as though she hadn't interrupted. It was a skill he'd learned young; if you paused for half a second talking to Mama, she'd fill the gap and just keep going. "But by the time I got there and a priest got back, $the bad thing will have happened$. Besides, there's a war on. I don't know if anyone would be allowed to come."

"I know there's a war on!" she shouted at him. "Don't you think I know there's a war on? It's the war that took my only son to the army fort, for all the good it did me when $enemy soldiers$ came crashing through the forest with their spells and their poisons and cursed our village." She collapsed against his shoulder, sobbing. 

"I'm sorry, Ma," he said, patting her shoulder awkwardly. He'd been gone long enough to have lost the habit of comforting her. "But, look, I can't fix it but maybe Josie can." 

She stiffened, sobs disappearing immediately. "That harridan? No better than she should be, lording it over everyone because her mama thinks she was a noble's get." 

Whether Mama believed it or not, Josie's grandmother had been the King's $something$ before the Purge, and while the Purge had cost a lot of people their lives, the mage-hunters had mostly gone after the men. 

Mama sniffed with the same derision she directed at anyone whose family was new enough to village life that anyone remembered how their family had gotten there."Fine. You go bring here here and ask her to help. But don't let me catch you mooning over that girl, Mack, she's no good for you and you know it."
