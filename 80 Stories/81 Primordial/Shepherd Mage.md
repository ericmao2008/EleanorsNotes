## Shepherd Mage

[[Tagg]] moves a thousand leagues from home to free his sister from a life of whoring, but when his ranch is inundated with refugees, he must unite disparate strangers against the widowed [[necromancer]] [[Anna]] if he is to save his ranch -- and his adopted people.

**Era**: Third Demesne
**Inspiration**: Hacienda / Mesta System

### Notes

[[Tagg]] moves to the [[Mestanese Mountains]] and herds [[nichtdonts]]. 

Takes place in the western [[Mestanese Mountains]] (analogue for the Pyrenees Mountains). References the Spanish [Mesta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesta) system, with some fuzziness about the [Crisis of Feudalism](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236661538_The_Crisis_of_Feudalism) which will have to come about from the western peninsula (Spain), which we'll tweak so that it had cereal production as its focus instead of being barbaric at this historic stage. Perhaps because of the influence of the [[Temple of Tef]] by way of [[Alliju]] to mimic [[Phoenician|Carthaginian]] colonization of Spain?

### Blurb

When territory disputes spiral tragically out of control, refugees flock to the protection of the strongest mage around, the foreign shepherd [[Tagg]]. He'll do whatever it takes to defend defend his ranch -- and his traumatized sister -- even if it means taking on the conscripted army of a grief-stricken necromancer bent on ending war -- by the sword. They want the same thing, but peace is impossible while raiders strike from the mountaintops. If Tagg can't pacify his fractious neighbors, the only people left in [[Panisa]] will be the walking dead.

### Overview

1.  Opening Image: Anna's husband is killed by a ragtag group of raiders. The remnants of the [[Cult of Valor]], perhaps?
2.  Refugees come to the ranch trying to escape [[Anna]]'s forced recruitment drive and conquering army. [[Tagg]] reluctantly agrees to shelter them and stand againstAnna, because he is the strongest land-mage around, and he needs new people anyway to defend the ranch against [[nichtdonts]] rustlers and mountain raiders unhappy that a foreigner has moved to the mountains.
3.  Tagg agrees to lead an alliance fo nearby landowners and community leaders and plans to stand againstAnna's army.
4. Tagg claims the land using a claiming spell learned from a from [[Tal]]-educated mentor-figure, and becomes King. He raises the earth againstAnna's army. Some die but most are just dumped outside of his territory.
5. Someone along the border wants into the alliance Tagg has formed, but his power can't reach that far; that individual is attacked with necromancy and Tagg can't help because he can't sense the dead because the necromancy pulls all the magic from the land, harming it permanently. (Note: this is important set-up for Maehlorn trees and when we loop back to the [[Voldshee]] [[necromancer]] arc and folklore and where that storyline goes).
6. Tagg gets Anna to agree to perform the claiming ritual and become Queen of her own territory, simultaneously ceding his greatest power and giving her her greatest wish; a means to end the border wars and destroy the raiders (those pesky mountain raiders again!) ... if she trusts it's not a trick and hasn't herself become power hungry. It's a huge gamble, because if she has, he'll never be able to defeat her.
