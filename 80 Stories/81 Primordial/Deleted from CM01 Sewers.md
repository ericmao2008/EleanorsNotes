“You’re disrupting the market in the middle of the morning meal.” His tone turned peevish. “I can’t believe en-Avestur would allow such a disruption.”

Damn him and his sense of entitlement. The cordon was barely big enough for a body across, and she’d waited long enough after the morning rush that that the oils from fried stale bread sat heavy in the air. “The only disuription here is you, en...”

He drew himself up, squaring his shoulders with as much dignity as he could muster with his face half-covered. "Tirigan." 

Irella’s stomach clenched as she recognized the name. She hadn’t been in Oruku long enough to learn his face, but en-Tirigan wasn’t just one of the Engineer’s priests, he was the High Priestess' lover.

She couldn't back down now. In for a dinar, in for a drachm.

When Irella was a little girl growing up in the Voldshee mountains, she thought the southern people were insane for building their cities right up to the edge of their rivers. No Voldshee would have placed a clan home beside a stream known for flooding, but the Nahrians seemed to do so as a matter of course. She thought it madness until her parents died and she wound up the temple of the architect. Now she understood the irrigation ditches, and the fields, and the silt and all the advantages that the river could bring for trade.  
  
No she thought they were insane for other reasons.  
  
She'd practically begged esteem, her sovereign and her friend, to choose any other city as his capital. Campion was old, small, and filled with people who hated her and him. But it was old, which made it the most prestigious of the Nahrian city-states that esteem laid claim to, and it was central, and if they could reform the temples, then the other city-states would fall in line.  
  
The Lysarian league would be a country, not a conquest.  
  
It was a dream Worth Fighting for, and as Irella fought her way through the market crowd she tried to remember that.
