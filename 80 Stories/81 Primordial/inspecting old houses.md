This whole [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/braidednosehair/status/1463903635096715269?t=TuPhHLlrS-SJ_v6RmQIi0A&s=03) is full of great #fic/storyStem ideas for the Temple of [[The Architect]]. 

> Owning an old home is great because you get to fix 60 year old prior repairs. oh you want to change that light fixture? in 1957 some dude named Dick hotwired the current fixture and instead of using a junction box just nailed it all to a joist and filled the cavity with asbestos. 

I like the idea of a priestess going around to homes and inspecting them. [[Irella]] during her youth maybe?
