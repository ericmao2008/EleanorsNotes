There were two kinds of people in the Dhortian palace court. The people who thought war was an opportunity to gain wealth and glory — and the people who knew that war only ever meant one thing: failure. 

When it was easier for young men to kill and steal from their neighbors than to make an honest living with their mind, muscles, manners or magic, something had gone very wrong. 

Sometimes it was the weather — crop failure, not enough rain, whatever. The storm winds during his childhood had buried half the fields in brackish mud a moon-cycle before the harvest and nearly a fifth of the valley had died, either from outright starvation or fighting the marauding army that revolted when the king couldn't pay their salary. 

- [?] where am I going with this?

It was [[Savion Euskara]]'s job to keep the peace, and that meant more than just banishing the dumb bastards sitting in his throne room begging for the chance to take their revenge on the poor bastards who had raided [[Port Valentia]] not three days after he had signed a treaty with every naval power within a season's sale that he and his would remain neutral in whatever petty war the maritime empires were fighting this year. 

If Dhortian had a Queen, on one would have dared. Instead, the Council had Savion. 

Savion had Nico, who he sent to Port Valentia to keep the peace.

The sensing webs out to sea were vital to the protection of Port Valencia. The captains who came through the shipping lanes hated the triplines, mostly because they tended to be independent sorts who didn't like to have their movements tracked.

Nico didn't give a damn.

The webs didn't just alert dockhands of an incoming ship in time to prepare to unload it, though the stevedores loved that aspect of it. No, they were also a vital early warning system for incoming tidal waves and tsunamis.

They were vibrating now.

The control bracelet on his arm buzzed, waking him from a light doze. He got out of bed slowly despite the urgency, wanting to avoid waking his wife. She was pregnant enough to need every hour of uninterrupted sleep she could manage to get. In a few months, such sleep would be in short supply for both of him, but he didn't have the luxury of ingoring the call.

Only the wave-warning webs alerted him at this time of night. He didn't get the alerts about incoming ships. The patrolmen on duty could handle rowdy sailors, and those signals were handled with a bright light atop a flagpole. Nothing so complex as invasions of his inner barriers to wake him up.

They needed all hands on deck for tsunamis.

It seemed like the whole of Port Valencia was experiencing a population boom, especially now that the Prince had decided that Dhortian should provide safe harbor to privateers. The details of that deal were above his pay grade, but providing safe harbor was his job, and even with all the young, strapping lads that had been added to the town lately, they would need all hands on deck to deal with a tidal wave.

There weren't just more people — there were more buildings to protect.

Nico threw on a simple jumpsuit, rather than the uniform he typically wore on duty as a guard, or the slacks and shirt he preferred. As soon as he slipped into the hallway, he began to run. At the same time, he started siphoning power from his aura into the city's shields, which began to glow bright warning blue. 

Someone in the central square began ringing the central bell, and the morning market clamor dimmed as shopkeepers swept the street kids and patrons up to the roofs of buildings to see if they would evade disaster. 

Water was heavy, and willing to exploit any weakness he might leave.

All around Port Valencia, others joined him, lending their strength to the protection of their town.

- [?] What are tsunamis like? 

* * * 

A huge pile of ceramic jugs stood in the middle of the pier when Nico %% [[Nicopimu]] — find and append to that story! %% visited on his post-tsunami inspection to make sure nothing had gotten messed up and snuck through the shields. 

"What is this?" 

The vases, filled so full of oil and flour that it would take two strong men or one annoyed mage to move them, were right in the middle of the most highly-trafficked section of the port — and given the tsunami, he expected a bunch of ships to be coming into port soon.

The [[snapper]] females were always close to the surface after a tsunami, and no Captain wanted to be far from port while they hunted so far from the depths. 

A skilled crew could usually drive away a pod of hunting males, but the females were shipbreakers. 

Yet, even knowing that, no one was touching the amphorae. 

"Captain's refusing the cargo, $title$ Nico," one of the dockboys who made pocket money running messages between ships reported, his piping voice at odds with his height. He'd have a shadow on his lip soon, and Nico made a mental note to make sure he wound up apprenticed somewhere in the port. 

No sense wasting a willingness to answer questions on one of the ship's crews. 

"Why?" 

It was unusual for a captain to refuse to take a cargo, short of it having somehow been infested with $shipborers$ — in which case the other captains would have insisted it be busted open and drowned in the harbor. 

No one wanted $shipborers$ on their ships, and he certainly didn't want them digging their way into his pier. If that had been the problem, he should have been alerted immediately so he could vaporize the little monsters. 

Otherwise, Captains didn't usually have the authority to refuse cargo. They worked for owners, and owners expected profits. Traders relied on their reputations so much that Nico had once watched a trader sell an entire shipment of red [[yhaoginli]] silk ==get the location from [[Swordwulfen and Delia]]== for a single barrel of wine because he refused to dishonor a contract in which his scribe had recorded the wrong number. 

"He's claiming the amphorae seals are counterfeit. Says the weights are wrong." %% [[2021.08.16 Stamps]] probably talks about this %%

"What does the portmaster say?" Nico asked. 

"That's the problem, sir. The portmaster is so dead drunk he can barely function, it turns out he's the factor's half-brother by marriage, so the captain refuses to do anything until he sobers up."

Nico pinched the bridge of his nose. "And no one came to get me sooner because there was a tsunami." 

The boy bobbed his head. "Yessir." 

Nico took a deep breath. "What's your name, boy?" 

"Torbi."

"Torbi, surely the portmaster has an apprentice or an assistant or a scribe or even a wife who can help with this, instead of the whole dock waiting for the portmaster to sober up. What do they say?" 

- [i] Nico must be new to this assignment. Sent by Savion, maybe, to clean up the corrupt port, a la Modesitt's book about Lorn? 

"She's a woman, sir." 

Nico failed to see the problem. "And?" 

"And the Captain won't listen to a woman," the boy said in a small voice. "He's from all the way out in Oena, sir." 

"Get me the portmaster's apprentice." He paused. "Do you know _her_ name?" 

"Anige."
