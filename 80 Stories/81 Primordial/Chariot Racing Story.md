	- [[2022-01-31]] did some brainstorming for the part about Luella's father smuggling things into Ulmes. 

"You're supposed to be this brilliant military strategist," Luella's voice was gratingly snide. "How did you let this get so bad?" 

Chaghalka pressed two fingers to his temple and tried not to snap at his wife. Even after thirty years of marriage, it was hard. They'd married for ambition, not for love, and though he didn't regret many of the choices that had led him to this point, he often wished he'd found someone else's daughter to wed.  "I've specifically been trying to avoid letting it get this bad." 

"My father says—"

"Your father is part of the problem!" Chaghalka snapped. "Do you think I haven't noticed that he's started importing [[yhaoginli]] silk through Ulmes? He's been trying to help his team cheat at ==dumbGame== for years." 

"It's not cheating! It's—"

"Taking advantage of the natural conqeuences of being a well-traveled and erudite man, yes I know," Chaghalka said impatiently. "I think it's the _taking advantage_ part people object to."

"Oh that's rich, coming from you. You literally conquered this place with an army!"

"Yes I know," Chaghalka said dryly. "I was there. Fifteen years ago. The world moves on, Luella."

"Especially when you kill all their parents."

"Which I seem to recall you encouraging me to do!" She always got him like like this, always got him so wound up. He ought to just ignore her but she was always so confidently, brittlely _wrong_ that it got under his skin and he couldn't just walk away. 

As much as he sometimes wanted to, the abbots would have a fit if he tried to divorce her, the way the native  Temples permitted. To say nothing of her father. Ugh, as much as Chaghalka hated the old man, he was too useful to alienate. 

"This kind of nonsense is exactly what I was trying to stop when I told the Bureaucrats ==something analogous to Justinians crackdowns on chariot-racing riots==, but no, everyone told me I was being ridiculous. Including you." He pitched his voice high in a brutal mimicry of her piercingly high-pitched voice. "A bunch of exuberant sports fans celebrating can't possibly be a threat to my reign, oh just let the boys be boys and have their fun, it's harmless."

She opened her mouth to retort but ignored her and kept going. 

"Well look at us now, half of my counselors are huddling in the palace and the mages are asking me if I want to flatten the city I spent the last ten years cajoling the damn Architects into helping me build." 

"Well if you haven't gotten involved—"

"The hell was I supposed to do? Those damn games are the most popular thing I sponsor. You'd rather I have kept on being some faceless monster to these people? At least when I go out there and cheer for the ==Greens== people remember I'm a _person._" 

"A person whose throne can be stolen!" 

He snorted. "Those people out there aren't thinking about my throne, you idiot. If this were a coup attempt, I'd round up the perpetrators and ==pop their heads into the river like grapes.== They aren't thinking at all and the pisser of it is, they really are just a bunch of otherwise normal people who are just so wound up over _absolutely nothing important_ that they're 

- [!] that definitely needs a better metaphor lol 

"I'm sure it's important to them," 

"Never met a real riot, have you?" he could be snide when he wanted to, too. "Those people out there aren't actually thinking about the poor bastard they're claiming to want to save. They're burning shit to burn shit."

"That's ridiculous," she sniffed. "Everybody has a reason for things, Chaghalka. Honestly, why don't you just go out there and tell them you'll change the execution schedule?"

"Why don't you stop coming up with a bunch of bullshit ideas that won't solve anything and start helping by doing something useful like shutting up so I can think? As a bonus, maybe you could talk to your father about knocking it off with smuggling in foreign drugs that get his team so wound up they murder people over a plate of fish guts?" 

"I can't believe you're blaming Daddy for this!" she shrieked.  

"I can't believe you're honestly suggesting that I go to the Temple of the Bureaucrat and suggest that they rejigger their entire festival calendar to placate a bunch of people who actually just want me to pardon one guy."

"Well, then pardon him! Look at what they're doing to the gardens!"

He pinched the bridge of his nose. "There are fifty thousand people out there, Luella. If I walk out into the promenade right now they'll rip me apart."

"I thought you were _the Conqueror!_ The greatest mage this stupid island had ever seen." 

He snorted. "I'm not a god, Luella, and not even the old gods were powerful enough to personally convince fifty thousand people to _listen._"

"Then kill them!" 

 Killing them would be easy, but then who would work the farms? The boats? 
 
 A knock at the door. 
 
 "They burned down the Temple of the Bureaucrat," his guard reported. 
 
"You can't allow this, Chaghalka." 

He sighed. "Call in the army to suppress the fires," he ordered. 

He wasn't willing to kill everyone in the city, but neither was he willing to watch it burn.

- [I] have this be a meta format thing and the parts where all my passionate rage that doesn't fit into the story goes. 

"Canpium wasn't some merciless backwater, Catie," Jack said patiently. He had been thrilled at first when she'd agreed to study together, but the more she talked, the more he regretted his crush. "Lysarians invented the first legal code; they literally deified judges."

Catie snorted. "You think having a big fancy legal code for how to address all the the things that could go wrong made them enlightened, Jack? Come off it. 

- [I] #nonfic/articleSeed/afterword My favorite Doctor Who storyline was "A Good Man Goes to War" partially because I absolutely adore Dr. River Song and partially because the Doctor's "I am not the good man, I am not a good man, that's why I have so many rules. If I were a good man, I would not need them" really resonated with me and blew my mind. The idea that a "sophisticated" city with a "vast legal code" means that a city has "a strong social order" flies utterly in the face of my experiences as an American who has studied our incredibly complex legal system and then also watched the news for more than six seconds of my life (c.f. Kyle Rittenhouse trial)

"He was supposed to be this brilliant strategist," Catie said, rolling her eyes at her textbook. "I don't get why he didn't just crush them." 


"Probably for the same reason we don't let mages run the government anymore," Jack said. His father was a chancellor; he'd sat through enough tense family dinners to feel like an expert on the subject. "Being able to win a war isn't the same thing as being able to run a city." 

Catie rolled her eyes. "He ruled for thirty years after this, he can't have been that bad at running a city." 

"Don't forget the civil war after he died," Jack pointed out. "A good king accounts for his succession." 



"The truth is somewhere in the middle," the professor said.

Jack rolled his eyes. He was only sixteen, but he'd personally witnesses his father's political opponents make up absolutely insane lies about his mother, who he knew for a certain-sure fact had not spent the summer having sex with literal snakes — she'd been too busy keeping his dumbass little sister from breaking her leg _again_. His father's side of the story of why his motehr had spent less time in the public spotlight had been "my wife has been busy with our children" and the rumor mill had declared that "the eminent Mrs. Mallory is reported to have given bith 



"Can you believe they put the entire rest of his reign in a footnote?" Jack grumbled. "Like the only thing we might care about is riot suppression. The man had a 30 year peaceful reign after he conquered a completely foreign country and even though he was apparently widely loathed, there was only one riot? Not even an uprising? And we don't know how he did it?"
