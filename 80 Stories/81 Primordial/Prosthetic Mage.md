The hardest part of being a mage was how unfair it was. The strength of your power was baked into your aura from the day you were born until the day you died, and no matter how hard you trained or how much your family paid your tutors, it never changed. 

From the day of your ==Birthright Ceremony== until the day they planted a Maehlorn nut in your chestnut cavity, you knew precisely where you ranked — magically, at least.

Even a violet-strong mage might hesitate to offend a High Counselor's favorite composer, and the particularly brilliant mathematician who ==cracked the genetic code== hadn't been much stronger than your average forester, but those were the exceptions that proved the rule.

Power begat power — the ancient _biladiyn_ had proved that, with their aggressive breeding program %% see: [[Biladiyn Bred]] %% — and only the fact that powerful mages bred best with the powerless children of other powerful mages kept the world from descending into sheer, baseless brutality. 

Kaniene's aura was only able to condense aether from the world around her with middling efficiency, but there were two kinds of mages born among the Voldshee. 

The ones who accepted their limitations, and the ones that didn't. 

Kaniene was the latter. 

Not for her own sake. For her brother's. 

"You can do it," Kaniene told Zeik. 

"It hurts," he whimpered. 

"It's like walking off a cramp," Kaniene said, ruthlessly suppressing her twinge of guilt. "Keep working it and it'll feel better." 

His face screwed up into a rictus of pain, Zeik tried to cross the forest on the prosthetic legs she'd built him out of golden power. If she'd been stronger, she could have poured more magic into the constructs.

If they'd been richer, they could have afforded the services of a more powerful mage to give him back his legs. 

Everyone on the island of Maehlorn was entitled to have their injuries treated. The priests of the Healer provided their services as freely as any other Temple, and if the ancient practice of thaumaturgy was better-understood now as the same magic that fueled the Delta enchanters and the Voldshee necromancers, the mages of Nahria still did their duty by their people. 

Even Kaniene, who even now wore the ==I forget what color== robes of the Engineer. #fic/expandWorldbuilding She was no healer, but she specialized in solving problems with a savvy understanding of the interplay between magic and machine. She'd improved the efficiency of the Temple's the watermill designs threefold before she was thirteen; she'd single-handedly revolutionized the looms used by Pontero's silk weavers until they nearly rivalled the Monche for the popularity of their designs, even though [[yhaoginli]] were native to the highlands. 

So why was she struggling so much now? 

"Are you sure it's working?" Zeik asked plaintively. He'd only crossed the room twice, lurching and lumbering like a drunken boar. 

"It worked when I tested it this morning," Kaniene said, keeping her doubts out of her tone. The prosthetic _had_ worked that morning — on a three-legged cat she'd fished out of the harbor. 

The beast had yowled so indignantly that Kaniene wouldn't have been able to control it without magic, but in the end, it had walked on four legs, the artificial construct garishly bright beside its burnt orange fur. Its steps had been awkward, but it had stopped whining long enough to catch a mouse, a feat Kaniene rewarded with a strip of dried fish before taking the beast to the temple for the children to play with.

She had no time for a cat.

She needed her brother walk again, so he could 

- [?] Do what? How does this lead to the collegium daggeer thing? If this is in Voldshee this is _way_ in the future, they're mostly necromancy in the early years, right? Is Zeik dead? Disabled? Do I really want to go into a disability rights thing here? Probably not. But what can this be about? What is the desire that drives Kaniene? She wants to save her brother — from what? Was he injured? 

- [i] this is the story of the first Colliseum Dagger dudes I think.
