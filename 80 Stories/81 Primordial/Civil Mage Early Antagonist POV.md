- [ ] Add a scene from the antagonist's perspective showcasing: (via Laura) What are the factions trying to break the League a part? Who is the general who is most likely to rebel? I feel like that's information to share early on. That way we can label the threat to something specific as opposed to the League just falling apart. (this was seconded by Ari: we haven't really seen any tangible proof of that yet or any reason to understand why they're all so worked up beyond just that it could happen because the transition of leaders, especially the leader that brought everyone together, is a dangerous time for a new union.)
