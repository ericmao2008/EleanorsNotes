- [?] What is the conflict here? He wants better food? Use the [[Flash Fiction Template]] for this one. Does he demand something better? Punish a Gardener's Priest? There's an opportunity to riff off of [[2021.06.02 Beetle Siege (FF)]] and the opportunity for a really nice punchline from one of the gardener's priests at the end. But they shouldn't have tried to poison him. This should be their attempt to ingratiate themselves. But don't do anything overdone like "this is a delicacy and you can't appreciate it" find something new and interesting. 
	- can split this off into two sections, really. The first part is a good microfiction piece, and then can follow it up with a "response" from one of the priests. 

The worst part of taking his army to Maehlorn was the food. 

Chaghalka stared at the long, thin stalks poking out from the limp bread they'd been wrapped in and suppressed a shudder. They looked like corpse fingers, pale and bloated and nibbled at by tiny fish teeth. 

This was the best the much-vaunted Temple of the Gardener could offer?

The Temple was home to the only mages who bothered to waste their talents on gourmet cooking instead of claiming a patch of the world to control â€” or learning how to defend the one they already had. He could have baked something more appetizing blinded with both hands maimed. 

He took a bite. Or rather, tried to. Even his incisors couldn't completely cut through the little fingers; the stalks were tough. He'd almost have preferred his teeth hit bone, but instead the stalks shredded into limp little strings. 

Bitterness clung to his tongue, somehow oily despite the unpleasant crunch, and the faint dusting of crumbled cheese served only to confuse his mouth with the unfamiliar texture. 

Every meal was a bitter reminder that no matter many courtiers from home he surrounded himself with, or how much power he poured into frightening the locals, it was impossible to get a decent pastry on this benighted island.
