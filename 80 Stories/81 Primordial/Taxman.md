The village of Ansigon was not paying its taxes, and it was Anpre's job to figure out why. 

The life of a tithe collector was a lonely life — no one liked having their money taken, not even for basic necessities like building roads and staffing schools and paying the fen pirates to make sure the land stayed prosperous and safe. 

Most of the time, people's reaction to his presence fell into one of two categories; they genuinely thought they didn't owe and were quite apologetic after he convinced them they were wrong, or they'd gone far out of their way to avoid doing their duty and had to be harried into compliance.

Every now and then, though, something weird happened. 

An entire town just not showing up in his paperwork certainly counted as weird, so Anpre requisitioned a [[fyrpwny]] from the [[the Collegium of Tal]] stables and rode out to Ansigon to figure out what was going on. 

What he found there failed to surprise him only because his duties had long since excised any capacity to be surprised. 

There did not seem to be a single man in the entire town of Ansigon, excepting himself, although the last war had been nearly sixty years prior. 

He walked from door to door, and was welcomed him kindly at every house, but the tax code was clear: the mothers of young children were exempt from the ==name the tithe something, who's in charge of this town, where even is this?== and every woman in this town seemed able to have a toddler attached to her skirts.

She blinked at him. "I don't know?" she said, like it was a stupid question. 

But it wasn't the answer he'd been expecting; he'd been prepared for "out at sea" or "serving as a mercenary in the  fens" or even "dead." It would have been strange for _every_ woman in a town to have been left behind by a husband, but he'd come across those scenarios before. 

The fifth woman he talked to that morning, he asked a different question. "Who's the boy's father?" 

She actually laughed. "How should I know?" 

He could do nothing but blink in response, but she finally took pity on him. 

"When I decided I wanted a child, I traveled a ways with a trader's caravan. The guards were happy for the company, and I was ha
