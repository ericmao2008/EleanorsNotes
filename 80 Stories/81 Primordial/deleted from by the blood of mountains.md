Kala gritted her teeth as a wave of mourning washed through her, riptide rage in its wake. Her mother was dead, and there was nothing she could do now but finish out the refinement.

Long ago, the gods took our magic and bound it to our blood. Depending on the year, the priest claim this was to punish us for some great and terrible crime, or a blessing meant to spare us from the corruption and inequity that plauges the outsiders across the sea. 

We are invaders here. Our island lies off the northern end of [[Maehlorn]], a great mountain that juts from the sea. At the top of mountain is a deep crater. The priests claim it is deeper than the sea, but it is dry. Deep in the center of the crafter is a tower, and I am not supposed to know that it was built with the blood of my people. 

I am not supposed to know that the crystals my people trade across the sea represent power stolen from us by the people we have been taught to revere as gods. 

I was not raised to the priestess caste. I am a changeling child, concieved the day of her mother's fortune %%idiom for losing her virginity?%% when the winged priests flew up from the tower and bedded every willing girl on the island.

title:considering removing this

### festival scene
Kala confronts the Assembly (who exactly? her father? or an elder? Who is the real antagonist here?) about the missing crystals. She tries to get everyone to care that the chiefs are using up their resources faster than they can be replenished, but it doesn't work because:
1. the lack of prestige she has as a young, unmarried woman, aka a child wearing her mother's shoes (weddings would be last. She still hasn't chosen? The men are annoyed at her, but shes focused on bigger things omg)
2. the chiefs are like "do you want foreign goods or not, person, didn't the foreign medicine (from [[Voldshee]]) help your baby? Foreign spell (from [[Arais Delta]]) help save your livestock?"
3. Kala tries to argue that they go back o their traditional way of life or their god will be angry (the realmwalker #followup because he eeds a name and a characer sheet for sure) 
4. The retort is:"what god?" he might be dead by now. He brought us here and left us to rot!Why shouldn't we sell the crystals? $insert some religious arguments here$
5. We're going to run out!--> not if you do your duty! --> Iwon't bleed for you so you can wear fancy foreign silks (from [[Monche Nomads]]) and work a season less every year in the fields. 
6. Strip her of her rank and ake her cauldron!

### the subtle support
%% Boyfriends rally, forgiving her. Have a heart to heart where this nosense has made it clear to her that choosing is so pointless and stupid ; she doesn't want to choose.. She loves them both. Can they be okay with that?Because if not, the one who leaves first wins haha. %%

Mahiai found her beneath a scraggly pine, knees pressed against her chest, fingers curled into the thick wool of her trousers like she could somehow ensure that they, too, wouldn't disappear. 

"I'm sorry about your cauldron," Mahiai said, wings fluttering anxiously. 

"I guess you're here to find out who I've finally decided to marry?" she said dully. "Relax—don't worry. I'm not going to marry either one of you." Her voice hitched on the last word and she burst into tears. 

"Good work, dumbass," Antony muttered as he climbed up into view. 

"You're both here," she sniffled once she finally managed to control her sobs. 

"Would have found you sooner if you hadn't come all the way down here," Anthony said. The pine forest was lower on the mountain than their people usually ventured; he must have been forced to find another place to land, or maybe hover while Mahiai got out of whatever clearing they had used as a landing pad once they found her. 

Mahiai flashed her an impish grin. "Neither one of us wants to waste seasons of effort courting you just because the elder priests are greedy fools." 

"But my cauldron-- I'm not-- my father's already disowned me by now. I doubt I'll even be allowed to marry, not after what I said back at the Tower." 

"We were annoyed when we thought you were just stringing us along," Anthony said, more seriously. "But your mother had juts flown into the sea and it's now it's pretty obvious that you had a lot going on that you couldn't tell us and honestly, fuck the elders. They were the ones making you choose anyway. So we talked about it while we were looking for you and we'd rather both marry you than have either one of us wind up at the Tower." 

"The priests won't let me marry you both," Kala said. 

%% This is the refusal of the call so it's okay if she's not the impetus behind it! %%

"That's why we need to leave!" Mahiai said. 

"How? The priests control the whole island." But as soon as she said the words out loud, she knew the answer: the trade winds. The revelation widened her mouth and excitement straightened her spine. 

Mahiai nodded. "If we leave soon, the Voldshee won't have any reason not to welcome us. 

"Except we don't have anything to trade," Mahiai said, ever practical. 

"I guess I need to get my cauldron back," Kala said with a bright smile. 

Antony looked uncomfortable. "You shouldn't have to bleed for us. Your father was wrong to try and make you." 

"I thought—" Mahiai stumbled over the words, looking confused. "I thought you couldn't make any more aetheral. Not without bleeding for them. I thought that's what everything was about, back at the tower?" 

Kala's lips went thin. "Is that how they tried to spin it?" She sniffled. "Assholes. I can make aetherals. Just not as much as they want me to, not with my _own_ blood. Not without half-killing myself. It doesn't have to be mine, you know? But they wanted to keep it a secret, and you don't see them offering to slice a vein, do you?" 

"So if everyone bled a little into the cauldron—" 

Kala shook her head sharply. "You don't understand. The aetherals we've been selling are refined from the _bodies of our dead._ Blood isn't the same. It's harder to work with. Not pure. And you'll feel awful, after." 

"What if you used hair?" Anthony said. %% make sure to describe them all as having long hair elsewhere %%  

Kala opened her mouth, then closed it. "That's... I don't know. Maybe? We don't need something the size of a Festival Stone to trade with the Voldshee. We aren't trying to buy a clan's worth of silk. Just a chance to not starve." 



### retrieve the cauldron 
adventure stealing it back, probably from the tower, will definitely need to fly here. Take [[tulpi]]. 

steps: 
- one of the men courts one of her younger siblings? she must have some, in a society like this.  
- the tower itself isn't inhabited, it's empty except at festival time, since a la Westwind or a Medieval monastery it was originally designed to house everyone but it's not really comfortable.
- She sneaks in after a snowstorm when the priests are "grounded" with the [[tulpi]] herds that are grounded from a snow because they have to feed from the snowbanks instead of freef floating pollen; she walks when most would fly so she isn't spotted. 
- Note the central area is slightly more temperate climate, a gorge with pines that is "deep" near one end, because there are underground hot springs near the tower. 



### fly to Voldshee
%% When they land they have difficulty breathing. The Voldshee mountains are tall but not tall enough. The Voldshee must be the middlemen between Arais and Eheu. Voldshee use the crystals for what? Probably denoting the trees of sages; seeds planted with a crystal in the roots are more powerful and the spirits are clearer or something? Others from their age-set follow her with food and supplies. %%

The second Kala's feet made contact with the Voldshee Mountains, she shed the thick leather of her outer jacket. Though the men who'd come out to meet her were bundled in thick furs, but by Kala's standards the air was thick enough to choke on. 

Trees, thick with leaves, coated the mountain like porridge on a spoon. The smallest of them had trunks too big to wrap her arms around, a far cry from the spindly pines of her homeland. The canopy they created was so dense the locals had built their camps in the branches. 

Animals filled the air with more noise than Kala had ever heard in one place: dogs and cats and squirrels and goats, to say nothing of the multitude of buzzing insects no one had taken the time to name. 

She'd been warned, of course—her people had been trading with the Voldshee for generations. Only the men of Eheu spoke the Voldshee language, but no one could stop stories from spreading about the trade ships, and as far as Kala knew, it had been decades since anyone tried. 





Tusiata, always the better with languages for all that Mahiai had the sweeter tongue, translated. "They say they have our furs and medicines but are surprised to see so many of us, and so early." 

Likely they were also surprised to see women in the group, from the curious way the Voldshee were looking at her. "Tell them we're an advance group, not the main trade group." 




She could feel the [[how safe are small population colonies|sixteen people]] huddled awkwardly behind them, waiting for a chance to rest and fought the urge to hurry Tusiata along. It would do no good and might alienate their hosts. $person$ was exhausted; they couldn't go any further today. They needed a place to rest. 

"They're being a little circuitous about it, but I think they're asking if we brought any guesting-gifts," Tusiata said after a moment of halting exchanges. 

Kala pursed her lips, annoyed. She'd been hoping they would simply be welcomed. The first visitors had gotten that sort of courtesy, she was sure. Hospitality for strangers was easier when no one was expecting an exchange. "Ask them how big the aetherals they usually trade for are." 

The exchange took longer this time, and Tusiata's apologetic glances didn't make her feel any better. Would they be driven from the mountain because she was a woman? 

"They're impressed, flattereed—sorry, I don't think it translaets well, I'm kind of guessing here. I think I managed to get them to understand that you're a priestess, very special, responsible fo rour death-rites and creating aetherals for our god. They know of the Realmwalker, you know." The words tumbled out breathlessly in his liquid poet's voice, his stress running the words together almost too fast for her to parse. "Their own priestesses use the aetherals as part of the death rites of their most honored dead, the ones that haunt the the spirit-trees." 

Kala felt sick. The Voldshee were empowering the ghosts of their dead with the dust of hers. They were taking—no, be honest, they were being *given*—power meant to bring their god safely home. 

It was sacrilege. 

She said nothing of her feelings out loud. "What size aetherals are they expecting, Tusiata?" 

She couldn't say why she needed to kow so badly. Using any size for trade was a perversion of the duty her people had been given by the Realmwalker, and she already knew that the store her people had been building for centuries had been squandered so that foreign trees could hold the souls of the dead. 

The Voldshee man held up his hand, pointer finger touching his thumb to make a circle. 

"They're expecting six thousand aetherals," Tusiata said. 

It would take Kala half a year to make a tenth that much. She suppressed a growl of frustration. The Voldshee had no notion of the value of her labor or the worth of it. "Thank them for the information," Kala said. "Tell them that I've brought them a guest gift." 

Kala reached into the pouch at her throat at her throat and pulled out the smallest aetehral she had. No bigger than the last joint of her tiny toe, it was nonetheless precious to her.

Instead of handing it to one of the Voldshee, she unsheathed the her knife and brought its blade to the scabbed skin of her arm. The Voldshee gasped when they saw her bare skin—or maybe it was her blue blood. The tales of war taught that the other peoples of Verraine bled red. Even their skin was pink, like voles. 

Kala pressed 


### new home
They go east to the highlands and settle there. They build a new tower, and everyone sacrifices a tiny bit of blood, making the cauldron a group ritual and not a secret, and the boyfriend (one is a poet / storyteller / drummer, the other is a carpenter / carver) composes an oral history since their tower isn't magical.  

### epilogue 

"Are you the god?" asks one of the gasping priests. 

Jhebhu smirked. What was it his tutor used to say? A sufficiently advanced magician was indistinguishable from a god. "Probably," he said, then frowned. "Where are the crystals"

The priests face went carefully blank. "The aetherals I brought you here to make." He flung a tendril of power into the walls of the tower. The instructions boomed through the air. He could sense the land below; there was no bluestone in the quarries. "Don't tell me you forgot how to refine aetheral. My directions were very explicit."



"Yes sire. No sire." The priest swallowed, then stuttered. "We sold them, my Lord."

"Oh, you fools."

"Will you punish us?" He asked, abasing himself. 

"Punish you? No. But I can't protect you from what is coming, without those crystals."

Mention the splinter faction. "Kala was right." The priest whispered.
