Involve [[moonfish]]? People from the [[Arais Delta]]? The [[2020.10.19 Horseboats]] newsletter might have some good references. 

It could be from Enduca's point of view: the horseboat river cruise north after [[Eramepi]] died, i.e. during the transition to [[Civil Mage Chapter 04 - Marna|Civil Mage Chapter 03.2]]. 

Goal could be to same [[60 Characters/b. ATA 100-199/Irella]] from an attacker, but instead of being a political threat, it could be a predatory creature that eats [[moonfish]]? ( #fic/storyStem  ) 

An [[Enduca]] story could involve: 
* learning to fish
* how she's used to being an engineer's guard.

Start out teaching a smart-mouth sailor a lesson -- why yes, she does know how to use the sword at her back. 

(He's a pretty boy, maybe the son of the ox puller. They switch off to pull 24/7 so he's basically the night crew and gets some time off to be idle, eat, etc., although he's also part of the stevedore crew doing loading, offloading, guard stuff, etc)

"What? You didn't think I knew how to use it?" 

*Biladiyn* women were rare, but not unknown. Any woman who wanted life by the sword served the Templesâ€”the armies and the guards wouldn't take them, but the Temples didn't discriminate; really only the military did. Half the gods were women, after all. The Engineer certainly was; her High Priestess had almost looked ashamed when she sent Enduca away from the capitol for daring to treat a thaumaturge with respect when the High Priestesss' lover -- the drunken priest she had been set to guard in [[Civil Mage Chapter 01 - Sewers|Civil Mage Chapter 01]] -- had publically insulted the thaumaturge. 

Enduca sighed. No use resenting it now. Not...

Moonfish in the predator's belly. They can split the scales and everyone on the crew would have enough money to buy (something expensive) <-- that should be dialogue. 

It would all go to the *biladiyn* coffers, of course. Guardians from the [[Order of the Hallowed Dakhma]] had no need of material wealth.

But honestly there are so many boats on that river that it's not totally viable for that sort of attack to happen. So if that's the plot, it should take place on the [[Wasatean Sea]] and star a sailor [[Arais Delta]] and involve concepts from the [[2020.12.14 Navigation]] newsletter. 

If going this route, have it be an Arais sailor crossing the sea, and fighting a sea monster... great source here would be [[Elissa]] and her guards instead of [[Enduca]]. Ultimately this should be suited to the Cosmology issue of [[Worldbuilding Magazine]] and involve [[2020.12.14 Navigation]] newsletter as the infobox research tips for that "series."
