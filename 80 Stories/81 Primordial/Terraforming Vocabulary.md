- [I] should I make this more of a [[Verraine]] story by swapping out Mars/Earth/Horses? I probably could make it a portal story, but better to go with the obvious stand-ins before I layer in worldbuilding. 

The first step on the path to mars was changing our vocabulary.

We didn't need to make Mars more like Earth, any more than our goal was ever to make horses more like dogs — or even, in our later years, foxes. 

The fact that a herd of sheep and a herd of cows have similar social structures is mostly a happy accident, a byproduct of domestication, not a starting point. 

Horses and cows have very different social structures and were domesticated by very different methods. Horses trace their lineage back to one _male_ ancestor — a particular docile & agreeable male — whereas animals cows trace their lineage back to one _female_ ancestor: probably one prone to overproduction of milk. 

- [!] #fic/editPending to #pkm/crossReference this with the evidence. 
- [I] Also speak to the [[crop domestication timeline]]

Just because Earth and Mars are both planets (as opposed to satellites, natural or artificial — or something else entirely, intergalactic travelers like comets or generation ships or Niven's puppeteers with a captive star) doesn't mean we need to "tame" them the same way.

In the case of Earth, we domesticated biomes, bent regions to our will, and we tamed the deserts of Mars not with the machines of madernity but the chemistry behind our first calamities: fire. 

- [!] #research terraforming. Can it be done with nuclear explosions?
