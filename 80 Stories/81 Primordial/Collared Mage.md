### Synopsis

[[Minna]] accepted a slave collar from the Republic of [[Tal]] in exchange for protection. The priesthood teaches that each dead mage is a step closer to the gods’ return, and the populace believes mages are too dangerous to let live. When she is sent to the border by Praetor [[Gurges]] for defying his political ambitions, religious fanatics catch her beyond the protection of the legions. Trapped between a brutal death and the swift execution that faces a killer mage, she lashes out when her mentor [[Thrax]] is injured. Though horrified at the taboos she has broken, Thrax helps her fake her death and escape into the wilds of her native [[Nythyrma]].

When winter comes, she seeks shelter with [[Karl]], the young chief of Clan [[Erusci]]. He is willing to stand up to the priesthood — if she will help him fight the Republic, which is using mages to conquer the world. Though terrified of revealing herself, Minna knows it may be the only way to rescue her sister, another mage enslaved by Tal. She convinces Karl to propose a marriage treaty with Tal, but the bridal guards accompanying her sister recognize Minna’s collar and take her into custody as a renegade mage.

To Minna’s shock, the Erusci fight for her freedom — and despite the slave collar that limits her magic, they win. But it is a hollow victory, for with so many guards dead, Praetor Gurges sends the legions seeking vengeance. Though Minna and Karl are able to scrape together an alliance of Norrhian clans willing to fight, it is not enough. Tal is an empire with unparalleled magical and military might, and it will take more than barbarian warriors to stand against them.

Minna leverages her understanding of earth magic and tricks Thrax, who has been forced to serve as a scout, into misjudging the barbarian presence. She lures the legions into an ambush in the depths of the dark forest, and destroys them to a man. Gurges uses the crisis to take become Dictator and take control of the Republic. In retribution, he orders the [[the Collegium of Tal]] to destroy a score of steadings along the border.

The priesthood blames Minna for the devastation and gathers the zealous to confront her. As they try to drive her out, she berates them for rejecting the children of the gods, and in a risky gamble to prove her point, pours all of her magic into the earth. The sacrifice of her magic breaks the slave collar, and rouses the goddess Verraine, which allows her control the land her magic touched.

Minna removes it and the legions from Norrhia, but Dictator Gurges forces Thrax to raise corpses to send against the Erusci. His necromancy sucks the life from the northern forests, leaving devastation wherever the risen walk.

With her people facing starvation, Minna sneaks across the border to try to make a deal with Thrax. Instead, she discovers that he has been mind-controlled by the Collegium magisters backing Gurges. He captures her, and with her magic compromised, she cannot fight back. He takes her to Tal, where she is to be tried for her many crimes.

As outrage over Gurges’ demands for combat-magic grows, the rebellious Collegium mages discover that Minna knows how to remove their collars. They stage a jailbreak, and Minna leads them against the corrupt magisters and takes control of the Collegium, freeing Thrax in the process. Gurges marches the legions into the city, and reminds her that his soldiers are all that stand between mages and the populace, which has gathered to watch the confrontation.

Minna points out that the Collegium has served the people for a century, without violence, until Gurges forced them to use magic for war. Karl arrives with the Norrhian clans in a rescue attempt, but Minna declares that it is the mages’ turn to protect people from the legions. She shields the Collegium and the Norrhian army with magic and leads them out of the city.

Many mages settle among the Erusci in Norrhia, but a decentralized network of mages spreads throughout the world. Without control of the world’s mages, the Republic cannot continue its expansion, and crumbles from within.
