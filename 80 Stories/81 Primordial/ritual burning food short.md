- [ ] Instigator comes to a new village. She's young, and has magic. She travels with a single pre-biladiyn (biladiyn are founded after the [[Healer Mage]] situation, remember? So that should probably be after the gardener? But anyway he's her guard, hired by her father, whose job it is to translate, protect, and observe. Ultimately his report will be evaluative. Her journey is sort of like the wandergild in Recluse, or how the Amish and Mormon communities send their people out to experience the rest of the world. Note: [[Backwards Mapping Fiction]] idea here #nonfic/articleSeed for the stories like Recluse, and the cult thing Antonio had to deal with in Ilona Andrews' Kate Daniels series. Something like 5 SFF stories about {whatever that phenomenon is called}. 
- [ ] She is in town for a festival. They are about to burn a bunch of food. She is horrified; in the last village she visited, people were starving! Back home, the food they are selling is a delicacy reserved for the wealthy. The waste of it all phyisically pains her. 
- [ ] Protagonist is [[The Gardener]]. This is the prequel story to how food preservation techniques get invented. 
- [ ] She uses her (relatively weak, actually) magic to fake godsign to give the food to her instead. She tries to transport it, but it begins to rot within days. None of the locals want it; in fact they give her more. She winds up with _so much_ in her chart that it attracts a huge hoard of aggressive hyenalike scavengers; the biladiyn helps fight it off, but barely. He nearly dies. 
- [ ] She sets it all on fire, sits down, and cries.

Janiene trudged east a chip on her shoulder and a mercenary at her heels. 

Everyone said was godborn, a throwback to the ancients, powerful beyond their imagining — but no one wanted her in their houses for more than a few days. 

The Delta had spawned witches before, of course, and maybe she could have built a hut and enchanted the bits and bobs the fishermen found, scrounging for just the right touch to pull the scales from moonfish hides to make clean water, if there was a single square inch of the delta that hadn't been claimed by one of the trader families. 

It was tradition for Delta-born witches to apprentice to a more senior enchanter, and her father had no compunctions about arranging it; for money, of course, and a lot of it. Delta traders were nothing if not mercenary, and ruthless with the sale of their daughters. 

Perhaps if her "mentor" hadn't been a murderous old letch, she might have stayed. 

As it was, she'd run — right out of the Delta, letting her magic help her find north, cutting through the swamp brush whenever she got lost, furious that her gift had landed her in the clutches of such a disgusting old man and grateful that it offered the means for her escape. 

Not that the muddy cities that dotted the length of the Lysarian River were any better. They squatted over their territories like broody hens, and wanted no parts of what a river-rat witch had to offer. 

She found Teien in Pontero, another swamp rat exile; found him all but begging a an old woman to take him on as a riverboat guard, half-starved and clutching a bladed pole like he knew how to use it. 

Which he did, but the old woman didn't need a guard; she had three strong sons and five grandsons who came rushing back from the shops with the sunset, and Teien had looked do desititute and dejected she hadn't been able to stop herself from offering him a place at her side. 

Not that she was in any better of a situation, but at least together they weren't as lonely, and Janiene was confident she could protect herself from a man _without_ magic, if it came to that. 

As it happened, she was wrong — but Teien saved her anyway. As they made their way east, following smaller and smaller roads to smaller and smaller hamlets in search of somewhere where their skills might be useful without falling afoul of the bandits and bastards that fouled the cities, she learned over and over how lucky she'd been. 

* * * 

"Something's burning," Teien said, nostrils flaring as he sniffed the air. "Can't tell if it's food." 

Janiene was neither a strong mage nor a good hunter, but for all that he'd grown up in the Delta just like her, Teien was good at hunting in the dry forest they'd found themselves stumbling through. 

They weren't starving. 

But she missed bread. 

"Might be a village up ahead." 

Teien grunted. 

"Let's see if there's anything we can do to help." 

Most villages didn't need much that a mage could offer. Janiene hadn't learned the closely-guarded secrets of enchantments, and anyway enchantments weren't the sort of thing a mage could do regularly. 


Teien whistled. "You got that going so fast! And without any flintrocks." 

Janiene shrugged uncomfortably. Sure, she could create aetherflame, but it wasn't really better than normal fire, which anyone could make as long as they had the tools — which everyone did, even Janiene, who had fled Arais with nothing but the clothes on her back and the supplies she could quickly steal. 

* * * 

"Thought magic was a city thing." The old man looked at her doubtfully. "What can you do for us, exactly?" 

"I'm good with fire," she said hopefully. She held up her hands and made aetherflame, bright and cheery orange, dance on her fingertips. 

"My grankid can make fire, long as I give him the tools," the old man said. "You're a bit faster, I'll admit, but don't need to make fire too often, and it don't make much sense to hitch you up to our little hearthfire. Doesn't take much fuel, not like the ones they got in Sipparsu. You thought about trying your luck there?" 

Janiene shuddered. She'd visited three cities before she finally doubled back south. Nahrian mages got sent to the Temples young, even younger than she'd been sent to her bastard master, and dedicated in service so thoroughly that they barely had names of their own, just the same old repetitive spells. 

She'd heard of one witch — they called them thaumaturges here, she reminded herself, like magic was a miracle that only came from the gods, and who knew maybe they were right but she hadn't ever worshipped a Nahrian god and she was sure she could have learned to make rocks as easily as she made fire, if she ever saw the point — who had spent his entire career just catching thieves. 

Sure, Janiene could cage people with her magic — that was how she'd saved Teine — but she didn't want to do it for a living. 

She want to help people, not punish them. 

"I'm real fast at cutting things," she said. "Carved my way north through the Arais Delta with just my magic. You need a forest cut?"

He shook his head. "Ain't much call for clear-cutting, 'round these parts. Start cutting too many trees this close to the Voldshee, girl, and they'll see to it you're buried in their roots. Worship some strange gods, they do, but can't deny the found power in loving trees." 

"What about harvesting?" she asked. "I'm sure I can do it fast." 

He laughed. "Got another season before we'll harvest anything from that," he explained. "Ain't where we get our food. We send most of it on to Tehdet, and besides, we keep 'em short enough that picking ain't the hard part."

"What is?" she asked, a little desperately. 

"Well, that much fruit gets heavy," He stared at her. "Then we've got to keep it from rotting in this heat."

"You got something for that?" 

She slumped. "No." 

"Well, girl, you're welcome to come in and have a bite of pie and sleep by the fire, but I don't see as how your magic makes much a difference, if you're looking for a place to stay, and it looks like you already got a man." 

Janiene flushed as the man pointed toward Tiene, who had at least been allowed to make himself useful carrying buckets of water from the well. 

Which, "I can dig wells," she blurted. 

"We got a well, already, girl. Maybe you keep heading east, you'll find someone who don't. Now, you want some of that pie?" 

She bowed her head. "Yes, sir." 

* * * 

They headed east. They found a family — three brothers and their wives, each in various stages of pregnancy — who needed a well dug, and Janiene helped in exchange for a stunted goat kid who was at least another year off from making milk, if she ever did. 

"Was gonna slaughter her," the owner admitted, "but I guess you can have her. Ain't got much else to offer, really, but my thanks. You saved me days of digging." 

"What are you going to do with a goat?" Tiene asked once they were out of earshot of the little house. 

"See if I can't figure out a way to make yarn, I guess," Janiene said. "Or maybe see if it'll pull a cart, like the one that boy in the market." 

Janiene was a Delta girl. She'd been helping build canoes since before she was strong enough to paddle. A bit of fire down the middle of the trunk, controlled burn, 

Her magic made it easy enough to cut the wood to shape, and with Teine's help she got it into roughly the right shape. They even managed to hold all the pieces together with pegs forced into small holes without power. It was a carpenter's dream, except she couldn't quite get the wheels to work. 

%% [[wagons and wheels were difficult inventions]] %%

Every night she brushed the goat, and carefully collected the fur it shed, spinning it with her magic. She convinced a woman at the next hamlet they came to to show her how a drop spindle worked, annoyed as ever that she had to learn how things worked instead of just doing it with her magic. 

Magic was a useful shortcut once she understood something, but sometimes, the understanding eluded her. Spinning was an annoyingly intricate process, and she fumbled more often than she succeeded, but finally she was able to move the strands with her magic instead of her fingers, faster and faster until it seemed as though she could weave gold from straw.

The goat only produced so much fiber, though, and the village with the carpenter just looked at her rickety goat cart and shook his head. "Axel's too thick, miss." 

She helped him rough-carve timber into spokes, but he shook his head when she offered to do more. "No offense, miss, but you don't have the touch. I appreciate the blanks — saved me a mite of work, that did — but like as not, you'd shave off a bit much and magic or no, it's hard to put wood back on the log. Measure twice, cut once, and you got to know where to cut. The wood, she's alive, and you never know what kind of nuggets of a knot she's got buried inside."

Janiene tried to explain that the advantage of magic was that she could be certain she was cutting straight through, no chance of a sawblade turning on a stubborn twist of the grain, but he just shook his head. "Almost worse, that way. Got to go with the grain, or the whole thing's weaker." 

Janiene wanted to scream, but at least he paid her for the work making blanks, repairing her cart and gifting her a beautiful toy-chest he'd planned to give his eldest girl until she ran off with the neighbor's milkmaid and swore off children.  

"Solid cedar," he promised. "Can use it for those blankets you've been knitting, keep 'em safe from the moths come winter." 

Janiene hadn't ever heard of moths, but she promised to keep her creations safely tucked away safe in the box — if nothing else, it protected them from the road dust. 

She experimented with dyes, and there, she finally found a chance for her magic to shine. She rode into the next town, prepared to sell brilliant cloths of startling, perfect white and blue the color of the very sky, when she smelled the bonfire and heard music, dotted with the happy shrieks of children. 

She smiled. "Maybe it's a festival." She hurried. A festival would be a fine time to sell the goathair blankets she'd softened and dyed with her magic.  

As soon as she saw it, she skidded to a horrified halt. They were burning food! Mounds of it, just set on fire. Apples and pumpkins roasted in the middle of the largest fire Janiene had ever seen. 

Two men stood by with an enormous paddle, pulling off charred husks to dump into a deep, dark pit. Women danced around the pit, chanting in a language Janiene didn't understand. Their hair was piled up in complicated braids, twigs and leaves hanging from the knots. They wore dark clothes, rough like bark, and each step jingled with the small hard spheres tied to the hems %% like dried gourds with the seeds still in maraccas %%. 

"What are they doing?" Her belly was pinched from days of hunger on the road, and here were people just burning it. Wasting it. 

$Guard$ shrugged. "Looks like a festival. Maybe they're sacrificing their harvest to their god." 

She couldn't bear the thought of watching any more. Her stomach rumbled, pinching tight at the smells of charring fruit. 

They'd called her godborn. 

If this was a sacrifice, let them think her the daughter of a god. She called fire, setting it like a nimbus around her head. She froze the very air behind her and set it like a mantle around her shoulders, letting it flow behind her. 

Magic wasn't good for much, but it was great at making an impression. 

- [?] so why don't more people go the conquering route? BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE AREN'T SOCIOPATHS. Probably guard should just ask this. "You could just take what you wanted, with magic like that." She snorted. "And get murdered in my sleep, or shunned, or just hunted down by the temples? They have mages, too, you know. God-touched, they say. Their magic the gift of the divine, a loan of power, pah. Nobody loaned me my magic, or old $bastard master$ would have taken it when I fled. They want us to think it's the magic that chooses, that it's some force, but nothing I do makes it leave, and nobody and nothing would choose $bastard master$ for a blessing." No matter what anyone else said, she understood fairness. Maybe the Nahrian priests were better, and it wasn't a problem for them, but $bastard master$ was evil, and if the gods were evil, fine, but they wouldn't share their magic with her if they were.  

She strode into the village square, $Guard$ trailing behind her, and put out the flames with a sweep of her cloak-of-ice. "Tell me why you burn and dance," she said in an imperious voice, and tried to sound like she was waiting for a ritual answer instead of asking a genuine question. 

The people cowered. "We do our duty," said an old woman with feathers in her hair. "As demanded by ==underground necromancer [[Voldshee]] god.==

"Tell me about this god," Janiene invited. 

==tree story add a LINK to the raven story I can't remember the name of it right now==

Janiene wanted to hold her head in her hands. They were burning the food and burying the charred scraps because they had twisted some ancient story about trees into nonsense. 

Meanwhile, people in the [[Arais Delta]] were starving. "

"You will give the food to me," Janiene said, "And I will bless you with prosperity." "If you do not, I will destroy you." 

"$VoldsheeGod$ will punish you!" 

"While $VoldsheeGod$ takes his revenge in the heavens, your village will be destroyed. Give me half the food, and I will bless you with my favor, and then I will leave." 

They scrambled to obey her ultimatum. Janiene's gut burned with guilt, but she wasn't really doing anything to harm the villagers. It was a fair trade, even generous by the standards of her people. Even the poorest of the marsh rats knew the value of a fair trade, even if these ridiculous people in the hinterlands didn't. 

Janiene rode away with her goat and a cart full of $pumpkins$ and $bread$ — they hadn't tried burning the honeywine, she noted with amusement. That night, she snuck back, walking on air — a useful trick in the swamp, usually pointless on dry land, but it kept her from being heard. She left fine blankets, dyed in hues they would no doubt consider divine, and traveled deep into the woods with $Guard$ to set up camp. 

* * * 

It burned most of her magic to do it, but Janiene let the cart roll on a platform of magic for nearly two leagues before she was confident they'd gone deeply enough into the mountains that no one would stumble upon them by accident. There were no roads, no trails, and when she flew up into the sky, no nearby settlements she could detect. 

$Guard$ sounded concerned. "I thought you didn't want to be a witch-in-a-hut, or make these people think your godborn? You like people, wanted community, wanted to help. I've never seen you act like that." 

"I'm going to help," Janiene said, bitter determination in her face as she finished cutting timber for a cabin she hoped would not become a permanent residence. "But if they want to think of me as a god, I'll be their god." 

- [i] can I relate this to [[2021.11.10 Vapid (MF)]] somehow? That was going to be the conqueror's ([[Chaghalka]]) mom. If nothing else, this should acknowledge that it's the same theme in a "if you liked this, check out Vapid" sense. 

$Guard$ looked concerned. "That's a lot of responsibility to aim for," he said, but she knew what he meant was "The Temples aren't going to like this." 

She waved her hand. "I'm not planning to conquer anybody, $Guard$, relax. Besides, I'm not asking for anything they can't afford to give. They were going to _waste_ all this food."

"Do you even know how to cook it?" he asked, poking the $pumpkin$. 

"No," she admitted, flinching a little. "But how hard can it be?" 

She remembered the delicious pie she'd gotten in $previous scene man's house$.  

* * * 

Two days later, she'd finally figured out the trick of pumpkin soup. 

It was more work than she expected to strip out the seeds, and cook them. She tried boiling them, but ew. Steaming wasn't better. Finally she roasted them, and that was nice. The charred skin mostly tasted gross, and she couldn't really get the texture of the puree right unless she took the skin off, and no matter what she did it still tasted a bit bitter.

Bitter enough that she worried she' done something wrong, until she remembered that she didn't have any cream — her goat wasn't pregnant, certainly wasn't lactating, and she only belated realized that it was male. 

At the end of the process, she had baked eleven pies. 

By the time she and $Guard$ were able to start in on the third, the others had gained a fuzzy green coating and a scent that reminded her strongly of old dog piss. 

She fumed. 

Back home, there had been enough hungry mouths that they'd never run out of food. She'd never seen anything rot before. 

Well, she'd seen leaves rot, and trees, and snapper carcasses too tough and f
