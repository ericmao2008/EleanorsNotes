The hardest part of herding giant spiders was the brute work of harvesting their silk. 

Firen's hand crank splintered into pieces halfway through the harvest and it was just the thing he couldn't afford to have go wrong two days before the summer festival. Not when the trade winds were blowing from the north.

The winged Ehuians ==paid top dollar== for tailored silk and it would be ==years== before they came south again. If he missed this shipment, he'd never manage to save enough money for Janni's bride price and there would go his chances  of starting a family. 

He needed wood for the repair, but the yhaoginli had eaten all of the nearby acacia trees down to nubs â€” they were almost out of food, and he would need to move them soon. 

- [!] look for tools to scavenge. But the spider he was harvesting gets loose. 
- [!] He catches her, but she used up all her silk running fruitlessly and now it's ruined. 
- [!] He uses the ruined silk to bind the grasses together with the sticks (what sticks?) to repair the crank enough to get the harvest done.
