[[Iganmor]] served as a *biladiyn,* guarding [[thaumaturges]] and priests from assassins and their own stupidity, for nearly six years before he was ever permitted inside the [[Order of the Hallowed Dakhma|Hallowed Dakhma]] that gave the order its name. The [[2020.09.07 Tombs|tomb]] was sacred, kept so secure even an ant would have trouble entering, and

- [!] and he discovers what? What is this story about? Baby biladiyn grows up and finds that his mother was right? There's some creepy dealth cult thing going on? That would be hilarious. I like that as a moral. But it's probably more fitting if he discovers a weird breeding program. Didn't I have a note somewhere about them having a bene gesserit thing going on? Need to track that down.

Children. Hundreds of them. 

"An orphanage?" Iganmoor asked. 

Jirena looked horrified. "Oh, no, their parents are alive." He wondered if she thought he was accusing them of killing their parents. 

He wondered if the lady doth protest too much. 

Then he decided not to think about it.

"Where are they?" he asked. He'd never seen so many children concentrated in one place. Normally they would be helping their parents."

"Many are _biladiyn_ themselves; we pay a bonus for every child born to a biladiyn related to a mage, and given to the Temple. Higher bonuses for closer relationships, of course."

"Isn't that a little sexist? I mean, surely the men are able to have more children."

Jirena shook her head. "We have a firm policy of not taking children from their mothers until they're at least six months old, and most of the male biladiyn aren't interested in sticking around with a family for that long â€” or if they are, they marry and she comes to live in at the Order House. That's where many of the caretakers come from, actually." 

His mother was right. It _was_ a cult. 

"It's a school," she explained. "They learn how to fight, and about our history, and if any show the gift, we work together with Temple of the [[The Counselor]] to see to it that they're trained.

"Why?" Iganmor asked. He'd always thought the job was to protect the thaumaturges; the Order served as bodyguards, not breeders. 

"We need more thaumaturges, Iganmor. Our creche is sixteen times more likely to produce a mage than the Temples, and twenty five times more likely to produce a mage than the general population." 

"Why don't the Temples breed their own mages?" 

"You know as well as I do that there's always been a certain tension between the High Priests and the thaumarugres." 

"It always struck me as a little weird that the High Priests don't have as much power as the people doing literal magic." 

"A connection to the divine doesn't inherently mean that someone is good at politics, Iganmor. That's one of the reasons the _biladiyn_ exist. Too many mages were running afoul of politics. Our mission is to keep them alive."

"Unless they're too dangerous," Iganmor said. 

Darkness flashed across Jirena's face. "There have only ever been three thaumaturge assassinations in the entire history of the Order, and they represent an enormous failure on the part of the Temples. That she was willing to admit. He wondered what the secret records reported. "It's one of the major reasons we try to raise as many mages as we can here, in a loving environment, where they're given everything they need to be happy, healthy, productive members of society."

"I see," Iganmor said. "What does that have to do with me?" 

At the end of the day, he'd been born a marsh-rat, with absolutely no relationship to any 

"How much do you know about the origins of the Order? The founder, I mean."

- [i] must align with [[Healer Mage]]

"His sister was a healer who was killed because she refused to join any of the Temples and went rogue â€” the High Priests were in a conflict with the royal house of [[Keldehss]] and she healed him when he was dying. Her brother was the king's bodyguard."

She nodded. "It's slightly more complicated than that, but, yes. Which brings me to the other reason we began this program. We believe that, if allowed to live, $HealerName$ would have become the founding Goddess of a new Temple. A temple of Healing." 

Iganmor was a Delta brat, but after six years of service to the [[Order of the Hallowed Dakhma]] he was starting to understand the weird relationship the Nahrians had with their gods. 

Nahrians seemed to hate the idea of rogue thaumaturges, and for the most part viewed the thaumarturges that lived in their region of the river basin as merely utilizing the power of the gods in some distant aethereal realm, but some thaumarturges were themselves godborn, or perhaps throwbacks to the old godborn bloodlines. It had only happened six or so times in history, butâ€” "You're trying to breed a godborn mage. To create the Temple the founder's sister might have. You're trying to rewrite history."

He whistled. 

"No wonder it's a secret. The Temples _hate_ to have their power threatened, and the Empress has enough problems without us destabilizing the entire political structure." 

"You do understand," she said, but her tone was flat. He must have phrased things badly. 

Maybe he was supposed to have been overawed by the idea of finally completing the dream of their founder, fully committed to the mission. 

Iganmor always had been too honest for politics. 

"Okay, but. What does this have to do with me?" 

"We have a candidate." 

He waited. A child willing to go rogue and pioneer her own magic tradition was a rare find, but he still didn't understand what it had to do with _him._ He was a bodyguard, and if he was being honest, not a particularly good one. Oh, he was dependable, and no one had ever gotten hurt under his care, but he'd come to the job late. He'd been recruited in his teens, not during his toddling years, and he hadn't been bred for the job in the womb. 

He wasn't even native to this part of the world. He'd joined the Order after meeting one of the _biladiyn_ on a trading trip. 

"She wants to study [[moonfish]]." 

Ah. Now matters became clearer. They weren't recruiting him to the secret project because he'd proven his loyalty or because he had performed sufficiently impressively in his duties â€” they were recruiting him because he'd been born in the [[Arais Delta]]. His impoverished beginnings were finally of value to upper leadership, and now they were ready to take advantage of what he had to offer.

They'd trained him, fed him, clothed him, protected him, and given him purpose.

He didn't mind. 

"She'll need to go to Ulmes. I assume that's where I come in?" 

"We don't normally like to let thaumarturges leave Nahria. It can be dangerous, and there's frankly not a lot beyond our borders that is worth their time to see." 

Thaumaturges lived in a gilded cage. They rarely traveled unless a particularly important hinterland project demanded their time â€” like building a new Temple in a growing city, or making the annual $what's the word for when a king travels to all the places$ riding circuit to all the outlying village to check children for unusual talents that could be supported by the government. 

It wasn't often that the Counselors uncovered a genuis, but it happened often enough to make the trips worthwhile â€” within Nahria. 

There wasn't much opportunity for the Temples to get a return on their investment, sending thaumarturges to travel, unless there was a war on. He'd heard of one thaumaturge who travelled into the [[Voldshee]] mountains, but she'd been half Voldshee herself and it was in the middle of a war. 

Still, this was probably one of those times. Although he hoped they could avoid a war. 

"Moonfish don't travel well," Iganmor said. "As you must have already discovered, or I wouldn't be here." 

She knew he was correct; she didn't bother to confirm it aloud. 

"She's already been assigned a Sunsword, so you'll be acting more as a guide." 

- [!] import the sunsword stuff from the notes from [[(SS) Puff Pastries & Women's Bane]] and see what their counterpart was, plus consider renaming because I don't want to run afoul of the michelle sagara books, see [[2021-04-17]]

Iganmor grunted acknowledgment; the dynamic wouldn't be unusual. He'd never been assigned the coveted role of Sunsword before, and he didn't expect to ever gain the role; it was a _permanent_ designation, closer than marriage, when a _biladiyn_ was assigned to a thaumaturge with whom they worked extremely well. %% shades of the Phedre books here, be careful but also steal shamelessly as appropriate. %% 

When a thaumaturge spent most of their time in a safe location like the Temple or the palace of the Empress, and kept their heads down and developed few political enemies, a Sunsword was sufficient for their protection; their duties were more emotional support and grounding than anything physical. 

Few thaumaturges travelled, but when they did, the Order's policy was to assign two additional guards. "How many others have you assigned?" 

The $order head title$'s expression didn't so much as flicker. "Five. I believe you've worked with Joane before." 

Iganmor smile, the first expression of genuine pleasure he'd shown so far. Joane was short, blonde, and fierce, with $nerves like metaphor$ and a good head for numbers; she was one of the only other _biladiyn_ who could keep a game of $not-chess$ going on a forced march, without a board. 

"Who's the Sunsword?" 

"Franciosu." 

He'd been braced for bad news, was surprised not to recognize the name. "Is he new?" 

Amusement crinkled her eyes. "He's older than you, and both his parents were _biladiyn_. You haven't met him because he normally serves upriver, but he's also $HealerMage$'s brother." 

Iganmor raised his eyebrow. "How old is $HealerMage2$?" 

"$Sixteen$, but she's brilliant, so don't underestimate her." 

- [!] figure out how long that is in [[units of measure|Verraine Calendar]]

"Understood," Iganmor said. "When should I expect to be introduced?" 

"Now," $order head title$ said, and led him into a small classroom off the main balcony. 

- [!] go back and edit this scene so that the way it looks is similar to the central room in Sabrina the Teenaged Witch Netflix series, with a big sculpture of [[Healer Mage]] and her brother in the center, a big open space, books, and then the balcony overtop that leads to a bunch of different classrooms. 

$HealerMage2$ was five years younger than Iganmor. She was going to be beautiful â€” not in the way that appealed to him, but with the sort of $descripton$ that was going to make it harder to keep her safe, because anywhere she went in public, she'd be mobbed by admirers. He imagined the reactions of the $idle male youths$ in the market square buying finger food and 

- [!] didn't I write something once about Nahrian beauty standards where I compared it to different beauty standards in different cultures? Find those notes and describe her. ==Aha no, it was [[2021.08.11a Beauty in the cactus and the rose]] but I can #pkm/synthesize into a thing later.==

* * * 

- [!] write a scene about their travels to get here. 

- [!] add in a bunch of references to things that will read to a modern audience like "death cult practices," for example: black clothes, Kali style strangulation fighting practices, instead of a sword. 

Swords were for soldiers and governors. Bulky things. Ostentatious. Not really suited for a bodyguard tying to keep a low profile with their charge. 

- [!] angry swamp witch tries to buy $HealerMage2$ as a concubine, but she's not for sale, but he's pretty entitled and kind of a petty tyrant although he keeps to the local traditions and lives in the swamps in a hut rather than ruling the city per se. He attacks rather than take "no" for an answer. There's a battle, and Iganmor garottes him / wishes for a swird just as $HealerMage2$ manifests a spike through his sternum and kills him. 


- [!] Bishop-esque "You aren't supposed to have these scars on your soul" speech / retort. But to pull this off he'll need to be the only one present; were they in a team of three, one is bandaging the other's wound. 

* * * 

Nobody in the city would sell them anything. No food, no boats, no one willing to serve as a guide. On the one hand, Iganmor couldn't believe it.

On the other, Iganmor tried to explain, they _had_ killed a witch.

"He attacked us!" $HealerMage$ exclaimed. "What were we supposed to do, let him kill us?" 

"From their perspective or your Sunsword's?" Iganmor asked with more than a dollop of gallows humor. 

She took a deep breath. "Well, we still need a way to find moonfish." 

"We should go back to the Pontero," $Sunsword$ said. Iganmor agreed, but kept his mouth shut. She didn't need all of them arguing with her, and he could see she wasn't planning to change her mind. Let $Sunsword$ state the obvious so they could say they had, for the official record, and then get on with it. 

"I know your job is to keep me safe, $Sunsword$, but _my_ job is to learn everything I can about how to heal people. I'm grown, now. Locking me up in the Orderhouse would keep me safe, but it wouldn't let me do _my_ job." 

"You can heal people in Pontero," $Sunsword$ said mildly.

"Yes but I can't _learn_ more than what we _already know_." The hint of a teenager's whine crept into her tone, for all that she was clearly doing her best to sound reasonable. 


- [?] Do they run out of Ulmes for killing the witch / enchanter? Would probably upset the traders 



"Well," Iganmor said into the silence. "If we can't find anyone willing to be our guide, I guess we'll have to see what we can find on our own." 

$Sunsword$ raised his eyebrows. "You want us to steal a boat and paddle out into the middle of a notoriously-hard to navigate swamp, when we've alienated everyone in the entire city by killing a local witch."

Iganmor looked at him, appalled. "Of course I don't want us to _steal_ a boat. That would destroy someone's livelihood. No, we're going to make one." He looked at $HealerMage$, then back to $femaleGuard$. "Well, $femaleGuard$ and I will. Unless you think $HealerMage$ should go wading around in a snapper-invested swamp to chop down trees." 

$HealerMage$ looked intrigued, but $Sunsword$ looked alarmed. 

* * * 

"'Snapper infested?'" $femaleGuard$ asked, once they were away from the rest of the party. 

"Don't worry," Iganmor, grinning despite the waist-high muck he waded through. "This close to Ulmes, they mostly keep away. Too many teenaged boys poling around with sharp spears." 

"Should we be worried about the teenaged boys with spears?" $femaleGuard$ asked. 

Iganmor shrugged. "You're smarter than a fish, I think we'll be fine. Most of those boys, they're doing their season-tithe duty, not out here trying to cause trouble." 

"'Most?'" 

Iganmor thought back to $BrotherInLaw$ and grimaced. "Some of them are bully-boys, but nothing you wouldn't expect to see in the market back home." 

* * * 



* * * 

"You don't _hunt_ moonfish," Iganmor said patiently. "You set traps for fish and go about your life, and maybe if you're very, very lucky one day a moonfish shows up in the catch." 

"Not good enough," $HealerMage2$ said flatly. "I can't synthesize their purification effect if I don't understand it, and I can't understand it from just one sample." 

- [!] add a small back and forth here

"If it's a question of moneyâ€”" she reached for the bag at her hip. 

He held up a hand to keep her from opening it. The last thing they needed was for every cutpurse and trader to see the resources the order had showered her with. 

Five was excessive to have in constant attendance. No one wanted to travel at the center of a phalanx for their whole lives, and at the end of the day, the _biladiyn_ performed their duties on sufferance. 

No one could _force_ a thaumaturge to be a good body to guard, not even the high priests â€” though there were certainly pressures in place to encourage compliance with traditions. 

Still, five the bare minimum for a foreign trip, where they would have to work in shifts to ensure someone was always awake and on guard. 

* * * 

The old tree stand was exactly where he had left it. The tide ran low enough that the plagform was several [[units of measure|feet]] above the surface of the murky water. 

"Let me see if the ladder is still there," Iganmor said. 

The platform had been designed for one man to lift himself onto with brute upper body strength after securing his canoe. That man had been his father, long dead now. But Iganmor was nearly a handspan shorter and though he exercised regularly, he worried about capsizing the overburdened canoe if he tried jumping, or couldn't manage the maneuver. 

The last thing ==Sunsword== needed was to get dumped into the swamp with an open wound already showing signs of infection. 

- [!] ==HealerMage2== makes a sieve to purify the water. She makes a huge net to catch EVERYTHING, then they have an argument about how dangerous that is for the environment, how she's not thinking things through, how she's hurting more people than she's saving. There's an opportunity for a care ethics vs. utilitarianism argument. 

"Put them back!" Iganmor snapped. Startled, ==HealerMage2==dropped the magic. 

Startled, ==HealerMage2== dropped the magic. The wildlife fell back into the water with a splash so big it nearly swamped the platform. "Why would you do that?" ==HealerMage2== shrieked. "We have to save him!" 

"You can't kill every animal between here and Ulmes looking for a moonfish," Iganmor explained, his heart pounding from how close that water had come to sweeping over ==Sunsword==. 

She looked at him like he was insane. "They're just fish." 

"They're food." He tried to be patient with her; she'd grown up sheltered in the Orderhouse, being fed food she'd never seen the origins of. "Do you know why we fish with spears and not nets? So the oysters don't die. They keep the swamp healthy, so people can live here."

She wrinkled her nose. "I hate it here! The water is weird and brown and slimy and the animals are all trying to kill me and all the people want to rape me or murder me. I don't see why I'm supposed to care more about them than ==Sunsword==!"

He refused to be baited into that trap. He could already see that she wouldn't like the answer. 

"If you destroy this biome trying to save his life, my people will hunt you â€” and him â€” to the ends of the realm to make you pay." She would also doom all of Nahria to an isolated life with no trade with the others across the straits & seas, but he couldn't bear to hear her say she didn't care about Nahria, either. 

This sort of single-minded focus on one life was dangerous in anyone but a mother. 

- [!] **Analysis** Importance of Oysters for the Chesapeake Bay. #research 
- [!] **Analysis** Here we have a different situation than [[2021.11.10 Vapid (MF)]], but also similar. She's led a sheltered life, not because they were afraid of her, but because they wanted her to _specialize_, but the lack of a well-rounded liberal education nearly led her to destroy an entire ecosystem by accident. 

"Fine," she said, "But I'm not going to let him die. Find me a moonfish, Iganmor, or tell me how to get one."

He half-believed she'd kill him if he didn't comply. If that was what it took to keep her from destroying the entire Delta in her quest, he would let her. 

He sucked in a breath. "Moonfish aren't edible," he began. "Their only natural predator is the snapper. People mostly catch them by accident, sometimes in the belly of a snapper, and use them to purify wells that get fouled." 

- [!] **Analysis** #pkm/indexThis and find the notes I have (from Reddit?) about how people have been drinking water for millennia and that it's not really that we "only drink beer" or mostly drank fruit juice and milk and all. 

"I'm amazed this place has any wells that _aren't_ fouled," ==HealerMage2== said, wrinkling her nose. "But you're saying I can find them in snapper guts? Fine. How do I hunt snapper?" 

Iganmor ==reacted==. "Carefully. An adult male snapper will wreck a full-size galley ship at sea for fun. Sailors are nothing but a tasty snack to something that size. You remember that big ship we saw docked at Ulmes? That was a _small_ galley. And the females are bigger, but the adult females hunt farther down." 

- [!] go back and make sure that ships gets added as description to an earlier scene. 

"I'm not on my way across the Strait to [[Aakari River]], Iganmor. I'm not worried about what kinds of sea monsters threaten intercontinental shipping."

"I'm just trying to make sure you understand the scope of what you're asking, ==HealerMage2==. The only people who hunt snapper are teenaged boys in the prime of their, on patrol in Ulmes, and they do it in groups, very carefully, and even then a third of them die horribly." 

%% related: The exception is cases like [[Marsh Runner (SS)]] so be careful we aren't redundant, we're just referencing. %%


Under normal circumstances, only teenager boys hunted snapper. %% similar to how it worked in the Confedration novels where it was a rite of passage precisely because it was so dangerous. %% They weren't edible, and the bigger juveniles could eat a human whole â€” which was, in the end, the only reason anyone ever bothered to hunt the monstrous beasts. 

That, and the fact that the prestige of actually killing one all but guaranteed that a young man could find a wife. 
 
When their population was left unchecked, they stopped competing for territory and started forming hunting packs to take down bigger and bigger game and would even start raiding human houses. 


Delta boys between the ages of [[units of measure|thirteen and twenty]] had three options when it came to performing their tithe to the city. They could hunt snapper, perform maintenance, or their families could pay a fee to opt them out of duty â€” something only the wealthiest of the trader families could afford, and even then, only ever spent on prodigies. 

No one wanted to see the skills of a mathematical genius or budding witch wasted down a snapper's gullet, and the truly talented could usually find a sponsor. They indentured themselves for the duration of their tithe-years, but for most, it was a worthy trade.

Even the maintenance-track kids were occasionally lost to a rogue snapper when they had to go down into the water to repair a rotted dock or fix a busted $sewer pipe$. 

Iganmor himself had nearly lost a leg cleaning barnacles from an old piling, and he'd had a spotter to keep him safe. [[Biladiyn Recruitment]]

"I don't care if it's dangerous," ==HealerMage2== said, which, while true, was infuriating. For as badly as the girl wanted to be a good healer, she had no empathy. But maybe that was normal. 

- [!] **Analysis Idea** Adrienne's point about how too many doctors are in it for the glory, and mine that people who do well in ERs and ambulances are kind of adrenaline junkies. Some are kind and nurturing but... not as many as you'd think based on the trope of the "healer empath lovey dovey" person who shows up in most fantasy stories about healers. 

"Fine," Iganmor said. "The problem with hunting snapper as a mage is that they don't give a crap about your magic, they heal so fast I've heard of their skin fusing to a spear before the hunter can pull it back out, and they're strong enough to rip a net out of a man's hand if it doesn't just rip the net in half."

[[2022.01.05 The Magic of Marsh Protection (FF)]]
 
 "But people manage to do it," ==HealerMage2== said. "What would you do if one attacked me right now? You're a _biladiyn_. Your job is to protect me. Protect _him_ from _dying,_ Iganmor. I don't want excuses, I want answers!" 
 
 "I'd probably die giving you a chance to get away," Iganmor said flatly. He could see the scene play out easily enough in his head. The snapper, fat and smooth, external gills framing its hard-lipped face, would lunge from the water. He would make one last futile wish for a sword or a spear, snatch up the canoe's pole, and smack the snapper as hard as he could across its oddly-squishy face. It would absorb most of the impact, but turn aside slightly, landing awkwardly on the platform instead of knocking Iganmor to the ground. 
 
 He would try in vain to shove it back into the water below, but it would evade, whip-quick, and lash the pole from his hands. Iganmor would dance away, reaching for his garrote, and try desperately to catch one of the snapper's lunging limbs in a 
 
 Meanwhile, $femaleGuard$ would hustle ==HealerMage2== into the canoe, by force if necessary, because in such close quarters, with things moving so quickly, there was nothing useful she could do. Magic took time, and required focus to maintain. 
 
 ==HealerMage2== may have been a  medical prodigy, but her focus could be interrupted as easily as anyone else's, and he would lose before anyone could come to his aid, but in so doing, the snapper would at least have its dinner, and be content to devour Iganmor as an appetizer for the gourmet dinner ==SunSword== represented, with his open wound and swamp-sick-scent.  
 
 "So we set a trap," said ==femaleGuard==. "Give ==HealerMage2== a chance 
 
"You aren't _listening_," Iganmor said helplessly. "Do you think the witches haven't tried to purge snappers from the Swamp? They don't _notice_ magic. It bounces right off their hides. They slide right through aether like it's air." 

==HealerMage2=='s eyes lit up with interest. "Fascinating," she murmured. "They're as strange as the moonfish, aren't they." 

Iganmor shrugged helplessly. "They never really seemed _strange_ to me, growing up. They're just part of the swamp."

"Sounds like they were an awfully dangerous part." ==femaleGuard== said, her eyebrows raised. 

Iganmor shrugged uncomfortably. "Lots of things are dangerous. Witches are dangerous. Swamp fever is dangerous. Snake bites areâ€”"
 
"The prodigal son returns," a voice shouted, the voice booming through the trees, bouncing of the surface of the otherwise-quiet water. $Physical Description$. 

"I was never a prodigy," Iganmor said, keeping his voice flat and calm with an effort of will as he stared at his childhood nemesis â€” his sister's husband, $bro-in-law.$

It had been five years and too many days spent standing silently by while supplicants begged and raged at the gods â€” their rage directed at the thaumaturges that were his to protect. 

He'd long since learned to set aside his ego and focus on the things that really mattered â€” or he never would have left the Delta. 

He would have poisoned $brother-in-law$ and pretended to mourn the loss. 

Better for everyone that he'd left, no matter what mother had said. 

"I didn't come here for a visit," Iganmor said. In fact, he'd hoped to avoid seeing anyone he knew. Not only for his own sense of calm, but for his sister's domestic peace, and, being honest, because he liked the way the other _biladiyn_ viewed him as a mysterious foreigner, a son of the Delta, a bit of a wild man. 

They didn't need to know about his relationship with his family. His shrill mother, money-grubbing sister, or snidely violent brother-in-law.

- [i] the climax of this story should basically be "see mom? It's not a death cult, the whole point is to keep people alive." 

She snorted. "They spent the last three hundred years breeding a replacement copy of a dead woman. Boy, what exactly do you think a death cult _is_?" 

Ignor sighed but didn't argue anymore. She was his mother, she wasn't ever going to listen. 

- [!] this is a copout because _I_ don't have a good sense of what a death cult is still, lol, and I should probably have the exchange go on a few more times to feel emotionally satisfying and really get the exasperation across.
