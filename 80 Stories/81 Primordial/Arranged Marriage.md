- [I] This guy just got married.

Ejciak's wife had the blackest hair he'd ever seen, a shadowy nimbus that fell to her thighs and shadowed a face so pale that even the color of her lips was filtered, like a rose petal caught by an early frost. She came to him wearing a blue dress so faded and old that it nearly disappeared against her skin — a sign of prestige among her people, he'd been told, but to him it just looked fragile. 

She seemed nice enough, if nearly as subdued as her dress, and to his great relief had yet to say anything painfully ignorant despite having been born half the world away. 

Theirs was an arranged marriage, like many traders' were, but ever since the ==priests== came to ==location,== the rules had been different. 

- **Analysis Idea** [[2021.11.08 Inheritance]] / [[2021.11.01 Marriage]] reference about how the Aztec priests were mad about the indigenous habit of pre-marriage. Probably don't want to discuss Alec & I's compromise here. 

His parents had known each other for over a year before deciding to formalize their union, and his older brother's wife had joined their household for a season before they'd left to set up on their own. 

The new priests said the old ways were immoral and dangerous, and since the priests had come in the wake of an army so powerful their ==SOMETHING== had blotted out the sun, when they made claims about the preferences of the divine, no one was really in a position to gainsay them, least of all Ejciak. 

- [?] which priests? [[Cult of Valor]], maybe? Or the ones from the Conqueror storyline?

Ejciak was a devout man insofar as such things went; his devotion was directed to the pursuit of power and money, and so he was willing to do what it took in order to stay in the good graces of the dominant priesthood. They were, after all, responsible for nearly two thirds of his sales, since he was the largest importer of Oenan linen, which the priests preferred for their vestments even though it was coarser than [[yhaoginli]] silk and terrible for keeping warm in the cold, wet ==location== winters. 

Of course, she hadn't had much of a chance to do anything problematic, because she'd barely said anything at all. Not that Ejciak could really blame her. As annoyed as he was at being forced to marry a woman sight unseen, with nothing but the promises of a hired captain that she was indeed young and hale enough for children and hadn't horrifically tarnished her reputation with her own people, he had empathy enough to know that things were worse for her.

Dorotha had no friends in ==location== beyond a single spinster aunt, who Ejciak had agreed to bring into his household since her family was in many ways poor, at least compared to the standards he was used to, as a powerful trader from an ancient Ulmes family. He personally owned a fleet of ten galleys, each large enough — and boasting a crew well-trained enough — to fend of an entire shipbreaker pod on its own, even during the height of spawning season. 

It was that devotion to building his trade empire that had led him to marry Dorotha, of course. Her family was not wealthy in the way his people understood, but her father was the latest of a long line of powerful chieftans, and while it was supposedly a ceremonial role with little in the way of power, it _did_ mean that he was entitled to half the war trophies of his clan. 

- [i] this references the "how people manipulate their extant systems to give themselves ballooning power" phenomenon mentioned in [[social impacts of early cattle domestication in ancient Russia]], but there's also a version of it from Africa. #pkm/crossReference 

In exchange for a powerful husband for his eldest daughter and a series of enchanted weapons for his nephews and sons, he had been happy to pass along most of the otherwise-useless trinkets. With the weapons he'd been given, his family was able triple their trophy collection, and the prestige they'd gained had been more than enough to catapult Ejciak, as the old man's son-in-law, into having enough status to be the recipient of many "gifts" — each one of which represented a highly sought after luxury good in the cosmopolitan city of [[Tal]], which had long since ==something to ground this in the timeline.== 

He'd been promised Dorotha could read, and write, and perform enough arithmetic to navigate the northern ice fields. He'd also been promised that she was a talented carver and could create unparalleled art with the ivory her brothers harvested. 

He knew almost nothing about her. 

When tradition finally let them eat, after the tortuously long ceremony that bound them, he asked, "Do you have any favorite stories?" 

It seemed like an innocuous enough question until she offered a timid smile and launched into the tale. 

- [!] come up with something absolutely foreign and bloodcurdling. It should blow his mind because the moral is so outrageous — Black Jewels Trilogy levels of what the fuckery. 

The fine hairs on the back of his neck prickled as she spoke, but he couldn't quite process the words. He heard them — he'd never been an inattentive man — but though she spoke ==the Maehlorn language== well enough despite her heavy accent, he couldn't quite absorb the words. 

Ejciak set down his spoon gently. The ceramic clattered anyway, the sound somehow a violent counterpoint to the story. A few people glanced over at the sound, but the conversations around the room didn't stop to make room for his wife's tale. Somehow it felt like they should have — anyone who heard it should have frozen, shocked to the core at its sheer brutality, but the couple sat alone at the head of the table, as was tradition. 

Ejciak suppressed a giggle. Did she find his traditions as strange as she found hers? 

She was his wife. The papers had been signed, the bull's liver eaten, the silver knots binding their beds together firmly tied. 

He didn't want to offend her. He didn't want to be rude. He just didn't know what to say. 

Evidently, the benefit of marrying a woman by nature inclined to be quiet was that she did not seem bothered by his blank face or lack of a response. 

"What of your people's tales?" she asked nearly a full minute later. "Which is your favorite?" 

He almost told her the truth, but honesty compelled him to admit that ==something as ridiculous as Darcy's Donkey== did not paint him in a good light. He didn't want her to think she had married a drunk. His second idea he rejected as well — it was a love song (basically the ==gypsy steals the lord's wife song==), now that he thought about it, and centered around 

Why did all of his favorite stories have uncomfortable subtext? 

Finally he smiled. "There's a song I'm fond of, if you'd like to hear it?" 

She looked delighted. 

- [ ] riff off of rattling bog, except the life cycle of a [[snapper]]. "There was a frog, a rare frog, a ramblin' frog." 

She blinked at the applause. "Is everything a competition with your people?" she wondered. 

He offered a crooked grin. At least she didn't think he was a drunk.
