Flash fiction idea. 

- [ ] ask if it's possible to have "start" show up before "stop" sprint in the command palette / slash menu

Julie tapped her earphone as she impatiently navigated the voice-menu for her home insurance agency. 

"If you require a referral to recover a deceased pet," began the perfectly modulated voice, "Please say 'animator.'"

"You're kidding," Julie muttered before obeying more loudly. "You couldn't have aliased it to 'necromancer?' Animator."

Maybe she should have just gotten premium insurance coverage, but her car was a piece of crap and she almost never had passengers. There weren't any trees to fall down and shatter her roof, and her area wasn't prone to floods or earthquakes. Between the fae enchantments and the nearby emergency service station, she really hadn't expected anything to go wrong. 

"Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition," she muttered %% is this a real quote? %% to herself, then cursed when she realized she'd lost the thread of the automated directions. "Repeat." 

"To hear these directions again, please say 'Again.'" 

Lips tightening in frustration, Julie snarled, "Again." 

Three menus later, she finally had a case number and a point of contact. 

"Annie Animators, this is Angela speaking. How can we help you today?" 

"A terenth ate my truck," Julie said. "Neith Insurance gave me a referral."

"I'm sorry, ma'am, we can't re-animate vehicles. If your truck was inhabited by â€”"

"I don't need a wightwitch," Julie said impatiently. "My cat was in the truck!" 

Angela only perked up a little. "Do you have the body?" 

Of course she had the body. She wasn't ignorant. Julie bit back the complaint; it wasn't Angela's fault that a lot of the people calling probably _didn't_ know how thaumaturgy worked. Most people called it miracles, but Julie's mom was a ghost-fisher. 

"Yeah. I managed to deal with the terenth before too much of Whiskers dissolved."

"Ok ma'am, if you can just stay on the line while I pull your information..." 

Julie fidgeted briefly. 

"Alright ma'am, I've got your information pulled up in front of me. I see that you've purchased the _home & hearth_ package and I've got the report the Agency filed with us about the terenth attack." She let out a low whistle. "Big sucker." 

Terenth tadpoles were the size of buses and viewed smog as their natural habitat. When Julie first moved to Sgarth City they'd been practically legendary, but ever since the local school made it onto the national rankings list, they'd been getting more common. 

Lots of people were willing to commute if it meant their kids got into a safe school, and Sgarth wasn't hooked up to the rail lines yet. 

Probably wouldn't be, if the rail people had anything to say about it. Terenth frogs weren't too big a nuisance for the conductors to handle, but werewolves found the little beasties delicious and ever since the local pack caught the rail barons planting sickle trees instead of sword wi
