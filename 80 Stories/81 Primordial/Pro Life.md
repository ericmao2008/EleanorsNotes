The ==somebody== were unique in that they considered loss of life a tragedy above all other crimes. They pursued childbirth with a relentless abandon that frankly shocked [[Tyoka]] — his people viewed border wars as a natural state of being, as normal as stags butting heads in springtime.

People rarely died, and when they did the people mourned, but conflict wasn't avoided at all costs. 

- [!] Figure out how to have this "aggressively pro life" philosophy translate into an incredible willingness to have an absolutely insane amount of loss of life in pursuit of their political aims because individual lives aren't valued, only the philosophy of "more life!" 

The ==somebody== were so committed to life that even the idea of interfering with a potential life was anathema — their lands were the most densely populated places on the planet. 

Incredibly inefficient from a materials perspective, and their economies were overstressed beyond belief, and their constant expansion was eventually going to cause their population to collapse back in on itself, like locusts — but like locusts, they devoured everything in their relentless pursuit of life. 

They wasted no space, wasted no time, and had devoted an impressive body of research to ensuring twin births. 

- [I] this is meant as an allegory for IVF

Tyoka had never seen anything so alien as the cities of Zirlyth. Their homes resembled nothing so much as beehives, unnaturally bloated with angles. They crammed entire families in spaces so small he wouldn't have raised chickens inside, much less the eight to twelve children each woman seemed to have. 

The amount of magic that went into ensuring the hiveboxes were safe for human habitation beggared his imagination.

Not least of all because their reverence for life began and ended with humans. 

- [i] It's basically tenement housing, but actually safe.
