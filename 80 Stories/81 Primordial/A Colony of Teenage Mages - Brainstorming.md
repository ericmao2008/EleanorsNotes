"Magic Boarding School" story where the kids are sent away because they're actually deadly to their parents due to their magic. But Montessori in style instead of classes. That's a bit like A Deadly Education, but instead of being brutally competitive it could be a story of building, of cooperation. What if it's a "settle a random land" story, where all the mages are rounded up every year and tossed into a new land becuse it's the only way for them to learn to control their magic? That could be fun. 

Instead of the old "Jia's Cove" story starting with them getting off the ship, it could start _in media res_ with them realizing that something is rotten in Denmark. But structurally it would be good to riff off of A Deadly Education.

This has parallels with the Greek and Phoenician colonies, and probably Polynesia too. It works as long as there's unexploited land ---- and far enough back in history there really _was._ Don't want to let colonial era fears make it impossible for me to write a book.

Particularly in an Afterward. 

Structurally should probably resemble Hunger Games.
