A collector who kills all other examples of a thing to make sure it's unique. This isn't inherently mindblowing so need to add an x-factor twist, something that makes it particularly clever. 

The protagonist isn't the collector — he's the guy who destroys all the other things so the collector has the unique thing. The underlying theme can be something about the nature of "no ethical consumption under capitalism" except no jobs are really ethical jobs. 

Jergin goes into an antique place that's a lot like that musuem place and carefully secretly destroys priceless artifacts, like a spy but horrible. The inevitable conclusion of the whole NFT movement and stuff like Banksy shredding his art and that Andy Warhol thing that went viral yesterday.

Jergen slid his card into the card reader %% make that more scifi %% in front of the big stone building and waited until it helpfully _beeped_ admission. It had cost him nearly five hundred dollars to buy a forgery of sufficient authenticity to fool the museum sensors, but for once, he didn't care. 

He finally had an expense account. He'd finally made it to the stage of his career where all the little tools and whatevers he had to put together and shell out for in order to do his job didn't cut into the bottom line of his profits. For a freelance art $what's a good name for what his job is?$ like him, it was an incredible feeling. 

For once, he'd actually make as much money as the advertisement claimed; he could finally budget. 

Jergen tamped down on his excitement. Payment was still contingent on completing the job; he'd gotten enough money up front to whet his appetite, but he wasn't salaried yet. 

Not until  he completed this job. 

Jergen slipped the counterfeit credit card %% seriously need something more high tech than this %% into the slot behind his wrist watch and walked into the old $brownstone$ with a carefully practiced smile. 

"Welcome to the Kitch Museum of Mirrors & Locks!" the perky greeter said with a smile. Her whole body was clad in sequins; the effect was probably meant to be sexy and sophisticated, but reminded Jergen of nothing so much as a fish. Even her hair, dyed a silver too perfect to be natural on a face that young, was woven with sequins strung on slender threads. "Dauner party of one?" she asked. 

He smiled, "Yep, that's me." 

A quick glance around confirmed his suspicions; most of the other patrons milling about were in pairs or groups, but it couldn't be helped. This job was too delicate to risk on a partner, especially one of the %%call girls%% he normally called up as arm candy — camouflage — for this sort of job. 

"Right this way sir," she said, leading him to a nearby corner filled with an eclectic set of old church pews and antique chairs. Jergen sat down on the simplest; a metal cube whose polish had been dulled by the touch of untold asses. 

The hostess might think to blame him, a lone man, a little shorter than average, his hair cut into the slightly-shaggy version of capitol intern uniform, like he'd gotten into the habit during his younger years and never changed the cut. His shoes, slightly scuffed but otherwise expensive, told the same story as his tailored shirt and crisp slacks; just another peon in a middle-class job, killing time before a meeting maybe, but as nondescript as it was possible to be and still telegraph potential power. 

"Nice tie," said the tallest of the three women on the bench beside him. 

The whole getup had actually earned him fifty bucks to acquire, once he bought the bulk pieces and sold what he didn't need. 

"Thanks," Jergin said. The tie wasn't worth commenting on; tungsten grey and bare of any decorations save a plain silver tie clip. 

He'd considered a job as a reseller, once, early in his career. Problem was it didn't scale. Not in a city where even the high-end hookers worked out of shoebox condos and most people tripled up on rent. 

If he pulled this off, Jergin would finally be able to move out of the narrow townhouse he shared with three brothers and start _traveling_. He'd still be living out of a suitcase and a single room, but he'd be eating someone else's cooking, off plates someone else cleaned, and enjoying scenery that changed more than once a season. 

Until then, he watched with polite attentiveness as a holographic woman in a sea green gown explained the policies and procedures of the Kitch Museum of Mirrors & Locks. 

She went over all the same information from the brochure, which had also been carefully listed on the website, as she walked around the room pointing out precious objects that had belonged to famous singers and former presidents. She claimed that one faded brown photograph of a shaggy dog — the size of his palm and spotted with stains — had been taken by the first man to build an satellite-powered car, and for all Jergen knew, she was telling the truth. 

But he didn't really start paying attention until she casually lifted a solid gold teacup once used by the Satrap of ==location== to perform an emergency gunshot removal and the whole wall panel slid away. 

"There are eighty nine doors in the Kitch Museum, each secured with an unusual lock. Most of our patrons find fewer than five, for they change often and are well-secured. Each mirror holds a clue, if you peer cleverly enough. If you find yourself trapped, or in need of a bathroom, simply look for a big red button and press your palm against it. There's no one ever watching, but we'll always hear you call for help!" She winked, and everything but her hand — pointed toward the freshly opened door — faded away. 

The girls beside him giggled. 

He let them go first, and as soon as they entered the room, the door whisked closed. A moment later, a different door revealed itself, not two feet from Jergen's foot. He smiled at the hostess. "I guess this one's for me?"

- [!] try/fail cycle would necessitate that he get lost in some particularly flashy way. 

He'd come prepared, of course. Full-spectrum drones small enough to escape notice were expensive, but Jergen had bought three as an investment when he first set out on this career, and he had yet to regret the purchase. If you were careful, they could be reused again and again, and Jergen was very careful. 

As his reward, he'd managed to map a substantial chunk of the museum. Which mirrors were active on any given night changed often, but the physical layout of the building was harder to manipulate, and though objects came and went with eager patrons on a regular basis, the mid-sized pieces were shifted only rarely. 

He navigated the Byzantine hallways with confidence born of the certainty that they really _weren't_ watching him, making his way through a total of eighteen doors before he managed to find himself in the room he'd personally dubbed "goal six" but Museum records referred to as "the Sapphire Room," probably because the ceiling was covered with incredibly tacky blue wallpaper studded with plastic diamonds. 

There was so much _junk_ that it It took him nearly four minutes to find his goal once he made it into the room. 

Half-hidden beneath a white kimono neatly labeled "$8,000", mounted on an obsidian pedestal almost taller than Jergan himself, sat three perfect blue eggs that legend claimed once belonged to a famous author known for breeding heritage chickens.  

Jergen carefully wrapped the trio of preserved eggs in the folds of the kimono before smashing them together. 

Only eight longhorn blue eggs had ever been preserved, and his boss had paid him handsomely to reduce that number to one. 

- [ ] how do you preserve an egg "forever"? 
- [ ] need a try/fail cycle here. 
	- Do they fail to break because of the preservation work? 
	- Does some sort of alarm go off? Would be funny if it turns out the women do something to set off the alarm. But what? And do I really want this story to go for that long?
