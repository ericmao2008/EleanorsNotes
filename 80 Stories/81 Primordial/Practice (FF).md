Ten year old Savyn Euskara knew things were serious when his father walked into his room with a foreboding expression. Though Savyn -- already being called Savvy by the household staff -- knew the Green Jeweled Warlord Prince would not hurt him without a great deal more provocation than a broken zither, he was smart enough to have observed that he saw relatively little of his father, for all that they lived in the same house. Euskara Estate was huge, and Savyn was the son of a Province Queen and her Consort, both of whom were busy people. It was rare that he was treated to an unscheduled sit-down chat with the Consort, and he knew it was not a good sign.

Even at ten Savyn wasn’t dumb enough to speak without being spoken to first, and he didn’t have to wait long. “Obviously, I’m disappointed in you, son. You know the importance of keeping your temper, and though the zither is hardly irreplaceable, breaking your tools because you haven’t mastered them is the sign of a weak will.” Aitor’s eyes bored into those of his son. “I won’t be responsible for raising a weak-willed son.”

“No, sir,” Savyn said, his tone contrite -- and he meant it. He didn’t want to be weak. He was proud of the Blood Opal he had received as his Birthright three years before, and he had worked hard to master it and be worthy of it.

“Why do you think your mother and I insist on your learning to master the zither and tabor, Savyn? You’re old enough to have worked out that we do nothing without a reason. Have you given thought to that reason?”

Briefly, Savyn entertained the notion that it was a punishment. He wasn’t dumb enough to suggest that out loud. “Yes, sir. But I don’t know.”

Aithor sighed, some of the hardness leaching from the stiff line of his shoulders. “Maybe we should have explained before, but -- well, it’s too late now. Music looks innocent, son. There are those who think that because we of Dhemlan prize sophistication, we are weak. It isn’t so. There are many kinds of strength, and we prize the strength of the mind over the strength of the body, though it’s important not to neglect the body either. It’s a question of balance, but also, the skills of the mind transfer between one another. Given our lifespans, which would you rather be: intelligent or knowledgeable?”

Savyn answered promptly. “Intelligent, sir.”

“Good. Tell me why.”

“A fool who knows much about one subject is still a fool, and he’ll have blind spots. A smart man can always learn.”

“It’s not a question of can. It’s a question of must. You must exercise your mind as you exercise your body, and music is more than it seems. People think it is weak, meek, or merely entertainment. It isn’t. It’s mathematical, it’s linguistic. It’s hard to read the notes the way they are on a page, harder to learn than reading words, but you must exercise that part of your mind. Reading books isn’t enough. When you’re better,  you’ll learn to improvise, and there’s a flexibility there that isn’t fully free, there are rhythms and harmonies you must learn, just as in battle. Playing with others is no easy thing to make pleasing to the ear, either, but you will learn to intertwine your harmony with another’s melody, to lead and to follow.”

Savyn bowed his head. “I understand, sir... but why the zither and tambor? Why can’t I learn the horn?”

“It’s hard to play the zither with one hand and the tabor with the other, to read the music for both at once, isn’t it?”

“Yes!” Savyn’s agreement was heartfelt, and he truly didn’t understand why he wasn’t permitted to learn one and then the other. “Why does it have to be both at the same time? It’s frustrating!”

“It’s meant to be.” There was no give in Aithor’s expression. “You must learn to deal with the frustration, and besides. There are advantages to knowing how to multi-task and to being able to control each hand independently of the other. You’ll understand when you’re older. But for now, you practice.”

Savyn kept in his sigh. It would do no good. “Yes, sir.”
