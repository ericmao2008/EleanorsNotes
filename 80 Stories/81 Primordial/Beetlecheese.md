Tolui dot-Temujin blew a red-fletched dart at the smallest yhaolingi in her uncle's herd. It promptly colapsed, all eight legs curling in to protect its belly.

"Is it dead?" asked Padima, lately of the Gardener's temple and the lowland cities. 

Tolui shook her head. "Oh no, she's just broody. Won't like it much when we take her broodsacs, but we need the milk." 

- [I] something goes wrong with the harvest. 

Tolui's toddler munched happily on the cheese. 

"I'm not eating that." Jari hissed. He hadn't been an initiate for many years, but nin-Padima still despaired of him ever seeing sense. 

"It lasts almost as long as ==aethergrain== in storage, and doesn't require magic to process it. If your choices are starving and eating beetlecheese, Jari, you'll eat the beetlecheese."
