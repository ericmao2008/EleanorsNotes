## Forest Mage? Barbarian Mage? Island Mage?

Rainforest setting, modeled on modern South America and various Indigenous peoples. Quandary: do you give up your culture or otherwise acquire strong guardians to protect yourself, or refuse to be infantilized and cling to your way of life and get wiped out -- or do you rely on others to help  you and always have the uncertainty of that, plus the slow cultural rot? 

Change or die, but _how_ do you change, when your goal is to preserve yourself? How do you decide how much to change? What makes you "you" ? 

Set on an island perhaps?

I like the idea of the protagonist being [[Tyoka]]'s niece, , [[Jdanve]].
