	- Was the little girl was the egg of a dead woman? There's going to be an abortion/adoption angle no matter what I do, unless we go the "poacher" route. 
	- The "win" is when Burcad gets her back to her family in the mountains. 
	- Maybe base it on Rapunzel, but if possible find an alternative culture. Have the witch be the witch, move the basement to a tower, the kidnapping daughter element is already there, the prince is a sea prince pirate her dad's age and a different species — the witch's husband. But there's the whole into the woods element, and I can probably find more.  


Burcad walked in the door, his hat coming off with the same instincts that drove the dog to bark; habit, nothing more. The dog didn't so much as budge from the couch.

Burcad hung the hat on the coathook and limped to the kitchen without bothering to unsheathe his sword. Taking off his hat was good manners; giving up his weapons was the sort of foolishness that could get a man killed. 

"Oi, Tom, you scared me!" his wife said when he stepped into the kitchen. 

"Dog barking wasn't enough of a warning?" Burcad said wryly, popping a slice of pepperoni into his mouth. "You don't have to sound so disappointed I made it home."

She swatted his chest with the dishrag in her hands. "Ain't disappointed, you big fool. Just surprised. I thought you'd be busy with that shipwreck for another week." 

"Me too," he said. "We finished up early; got a new lookout, he got us through the straight slick as butter." 

Stefanie swiped the slab of sausage from the oak countertop and hung it back up on its hook above the hearth. "Well, go get cleaned up, I guess. We ought to celebrate, if we hurry you'll get a chance to say hi to the boys at the pub." 

After three months at sea, the last thing Burcad wanted to do was drink another pint of bitter beer and listen to another sad whaling song. 

"You got another man coming by?" He wasn't even mad, not really. He was a week earlier than she'd expected, and a sailing man from Arais wasn't fool enough to expect fidelity from a wife. 

Still, Stefanie looked disgusted. "Of course not." She shook herself. "Just wasn't expecting you, is all." 

"I been home early before, Stef. What's wrong?" 

* * *

What _is_ wrong? I want to subvert the obnoxious trope about a woman cheating on her sailing husband, but with something a little more interesting than the normal myth where she's a shapeshifter, like a selkie or something. 

Also, how can I tie this into the rest of Verraine? I've already got the piece about it being Arais.

Okay, so this is the part where they get interrupted, traditionally. 

* * * 

A small head peeked up from the cellar door. "Meim?" 

"She ain't yours," Stef hissed at him. Which, well, of course she wasn't. The little one in front of him was too old to be Tom's get; he'd only married Stef two years back, and while the girl was young, she was well out of nappies and past the toddling stage. 

Besides which, she had wings. 

Burcad clenched his jaw. He liked kids well enough, hoped to help raise a few of Stef's whether they were his get or not, and had sailed the Wasatean Sea long enough to be pretty chill about cultures not his own. 

The Ehuians were different. Animals, basically, no better than. He'd lost more than one friend to a Ehuian raid sailing too far east in the Braez Straight, and not like the pirate raids he'd sometimes faced in his younger years cruising the nameless islands that split the Wasatean from the Southern Ocean. 

You knew where you stood with pirates; you fought, you surrendered, you parleyed, you got ransomed, maybe you signed on with the crew. You could communicate with pirates, even when you didn't share a language. They fought from ships, with knives and arrows, like _men._ 

But the Ehuians? They dropped from the _sky_, swarming ships like swamp mosquitoes, killing whatever they could and stripping ships right down to the keel. 

"Why's there an Ehuian girl in our house?" Burcad asked. He considered it the height of restraint that he didn't clench his fist around his sword. 

"Meim, it's too hot," the little girl whined. Her breath came in quick, awful little gasps. 

He'd never heard one of them speak before. Not words he understood; not words at all. 

"She's not from Eheu," Stef snapped. She was already hauling a bucket of ice from the counter to the cellar. "She's born from an egg right here." 

An egg. Chrimeny, Ehuians hatched from eggs? 

"Why's she _here,_ Stef?" 

Stef huffed. "Three months at sea and you don't listen now? She was born here, Tom, what am I supposed to do, throw her into the harbor?" 

Stef handed the bucket to the girl, who whispered thanks and disappeared into the depths of the cellar. 

Burcad shifted uncomfortably. He'd stabbed his share of Ehuian men on pirate runs up to Urran for ivory and bone. Sailing through the Braez Straight cut nearly a week off the trip compared to swinging wide around Eheu Isle, but it was dangerous.

Because some winged bastards always attacked, even when the ship moving quick and skirted the island at night. 

"How did you get an Eheuian egg?" 

Stef threw up her hands. "I'm a witch, Tom, how do I get any of my supplies?" 

Tom's stomach curdled. "What do you mean, supply?" 

"Let it go, Tom. You never wanted to know anything about enchantments before."

"You didn't have a little girl in the cellar before!" 

One look at Stef's face and he knew it wasn't true. He wanted to vomit. There'd been a little girl trapped in Stef's cellar the whole time they'd been married. 

"Oh for— Tom, she mostly sleeps and reads old books about [[yhaoginli]] herders from up north. They do a lot with bird hunting, you know?" 

"You taught her to _read_?" Burcad squeaked. A surreal pang of jealousy spiked through his chest — Stef hadn't taught _him_ to read. Worse, he'd made love to his wife in a bed of margay feathers not ten feet from where a _little winged girl_ had been reading books in a room filled with ice.

And for that matter, where had Stef gotten the ice?

"Listen, Tom. It was that or have her pulling out all her hair in boredom, and she's too valuable to have her hurting herself."

"Why did you want me to go to the pub?" Burcad asked abruptly. 

"I wanted _us_ to go to the pub," Stef corrected. "To celebrate, like I said."

No. No, i

"Let's go, then," Burcad said. "I could use a drink."

Stef offered him a surprised grimace of a smile. 

But what he really wanted to do was cry. 

He'd have rathered she was screwing around with another man. 

* * * 

OK but seriously what even is this story. Right now it's a big awkward infodump. But Burcad doesn't know enough about the [[Kortien Mountain]] (?) settlers, to really know where to take the little girl and he's certainly not going to take her back to Eheu Isle, land of the rabid half-starved raiding parties. 

* * * 

That night, Burcad resolved to get very, very drunk. It only helped a little. He kept hearing that little girl's panting, half-gasped breaths, like a landed fish dying on the deck of his boat. 

He'd eaten the fish and thought little enough of it, and he'd gutted men just as easily in battle, but there was something different, something awful, about keeping a child, any child, locked in a cellar to bleed her for parts.

* * * 

The sky was still bright when the moon rose, but Burcad couldn't wait anymore. His nerves jangled beneath his pallid skin — he hadn't had such a wicked hangover since his teens, when his brother pilfered a basket of [[euphorigum]] from the market and shared it with all the other boys on the docks.

They'd run wild, then, heedless of health or sense or their futures, but he'd survived, somehow, and traded a dreary life in the army for the spoiling embrace of the sea. 

And marriage to a witch. 

He'd known she was a witch, of course. It hadn't meant much. The region was lousy with witches, ever since the Cult of Valour drove all the best bloodlines east with their mad quest to kill or capture anyone with talent or power. 

He'd traveled the world; he'd gotten potted in ports that would have looked at Stefani and thought she was a god, but here in Elford, she was just an enchantress, a bit more powerful than most but nothing special, no one to be feared.

She kept a little girl trapped in her cellar. 

Burcad shuddered. 

"Where are you going?" Stefani asked. 

"Breakfast," he mustered up a rueful smile. "Maybe a little hair of the dog. You want anything from the pub?" 

She groaned, shook her head, buried her face in the sloufiet pillow he'd brought back from one of his trips to the cold, flat plains of Ghoug Isle. The port there was ice-locked half the year, but for those willing to brave the glaciers, sloufiet pelts were soft as air and twice as light. 

He kissed her temple and slipped out the door. 

But he didn't go to the temple. 

Jaekk Cradle was an old man, these days, but in his prime he'd been one of the finest swordsmen in the Edarebian fleet. He'd earned his pension fighting in the battle for Ghoug's Teeth — Burcad was sure that if he'd had any sons, the mage-kings would have taken them for the Swordwulfen if they wanted to go or not. 

He didn't, though, or daughters; the old man had lived for the sea and if he hadn't lost both feet to frostbite trying to find a cheaper route to the ports in Rod, he'd probably have died by the sea.

These days he taught wharf rats the art of the blade, too crippled to teach the noble's sons or the army, but it kept him in coin and beer and more importantly, gossip. 

"Of course I've fought Ehuians," Jaekk snorted. "I've fought damn-near everybody with a coast on the North Sea, and so have you, Tom." 

"You ever hear of one in the lowlands?" 

Jaekk shrugged. "Heard there's a colony up in the Arthgavens, but they keep to themselves, not like those bastards out west. Why?" He raised an eyebrow. "You ain't one of my wharf-rats, Tom, you got enough war stories of your own, and when you're at port you don't normally like to hear anything but the fuck-cries of that pretty wife of yours." 

"Pretty wife of mine's got a Ehuian girl in the cellar," Burcad said, voice flat. 

"The hell you expect me to do with that kind of information, Tom?" Jaekk snatched a battered silver flask off the round wooden table beside his cushioned chair. 

"You've been around this town longer than anyone else I know, Jaekk. You ever hear of an Ehuian in the lowlands?" 

"

- [ ] why is the total word count and the daily word count the same? I'm pretty sure this actual file is longer than the total wordcount... oh, duh, it's the total wordcount toward goal. Ignore this. 

* * * 

"I wondered if you'd chase us," Burcad said grimly into the teeth of the wind. Reriana cowered behind him, whimpering. 

Stefani threw up her hands. "Of course I chased you, Tom. You're my husband, and that girl is worth a fortune. You can't possibly have thought I was going to just let you run off and leave me without saying goodbye." 

Burcad couldn't bring himself to put his hand on his sword. "Just let us go, Stef. I'm taking the girl home." 

Stefani rolled her eyes. "You're a sailor, Tom, if you try to take that girl up [[Kortien Mountain]], you'll get both of you killed." 

Burcad didn't point out that he'd sailed the seas of Ghoug, and knew how to survive the cold. Stefani — unless she'd lied to him, which at this point would have hurt but not shocked him — had never travelled more than a few miles from Elford, when he'd taken her upriver to Bearne to meet his sister. 

He wondered if he'd ever see Jaquie again. 

"You really think starving to death in the foothills is a better life than what she had with me?" 

"You had her trapped in the cellar!" Burcad shouted. 

"Oh, don't say it like that, Tom. She had books, and toys, and a room of her own that I moved heaven and earth to keep cool enough for her. I'm not a monster." 

Reriana clutched Tom's pant leg. "It's not the heat," she whispered. 

Burcad put his hand on her back, an instinctive gesture of comfort. Wrapped up as she was, he barely even noticed the weird bone structure that supported her wings. "What is it, Reri?" he asked gently. 

"It's the humidity." She took a deep breath. "The air in Elford is like soup, but here? I can finally breathe." 

She puffed out her chest and stared daggers at Stefani. "I'm not going back to swimming in soup." 

Burcad winced at the unfortunate phrasing; had she learned it from one of Stefani's books? She must have. 

"I don't care what witches think is normal," Burcad said. "I've set to port in a hundred cities, Stefani, and not a single one thinks it's okay to keep people like goats for their _parts._"

"Oh for the love of moonfish pearls, Tom, she's not a _person._ She's a monster."

"She's a little girl!" 

Stefani must have had enough of the argument, because she pulled back her arm then shoved it toward the ground, making the bright copper bracelets on her wrists flash and jingle in the alpine sun. A ball of green flame hovered below her palm. 

Burcad raised his eyebrows. "You used to say your magic was just for finding lost cows and poisoning rats. You said you sold charms to farm wives. But you've got little girls in your basement and bracelets full of fire, Stefani. Did I ever know you?" 

"Do you know why I married a sailor, Tom?" She took a step forward. 

Burcad clenched his fingers around the hilt of his sword. He'd fought mages before — but always with a pile of friends around him, and never his _wife_. "I guess it wasn't because of my good looks and dashing wit." 

Stefani barked a hyena-brittle laugh. "Darling, you've got a bum knee, a busted cheek, and your funniest stories are all about half-starved wharf rats fighting dysentery. No, I didn't marry you for your wit, you bastard, I married you because you were _gone_ for half the year, so I could do my work in peace without having to worry about every old biddy in town wondering where I got my money or who they could shove into my bed." 

Tom's skin prickled with fear. "Is this the part where you kill me, animate my body, take me home and prop me up in the window?" 

"No, you ass, this is the part where I kill you and tell everybody you died at sea." 

She threw the fireball at his face. 

Reriana screamed. Burcad snatched his sword from his scabbard and flung the blade up between his face and the ball of flame, parrying it." 

"What the hell?" Stefani said when the sword absorbed the flame. The dull grey metal took on a faint green tint, but otherwise remained unchanged.

"You're not the only one who didn't like to bring their work home to the marriage bed," Burcad grunted. His fingers tingled from the force of the fire, but he didn't let it effect his grip. 

"You've had an enchanted sword this whole time and you didn't tell me?" Stefani shrieked. "Do you have any idea how hard I've worked to learn how to do enchantments, Tom? Do you know how rare enchanted swords are?" 

Burcad snorted. "Obviously, Stef. Why do you think I never talk about it?" 

"Where did you get it?" she asked greedily. 

"Let us go, and maybe I'll tell you." 

God love her, he could tell she was thinking about it. 

He tried sweetening the deal. "Hell, let me take Reriani back to her people, and I'll take 

She looked sad. "I think it's a little late for that, don't you, Tom? We'd both spend the whole time worrying about getting tossed overboard for the sharks to eat." 

"You're the one who tossed a fireball at my head," Burcad said sadly. "I haven't ever tried to hurt you." 

"You think having my husband leave me for a toddler didn't _hurt_, Tom?" She threw another fireball. "You think it doesn't hurt to know that you've been carrying around a _priceless artifact_ the whole time we've been married, without so much as mentioning it?" And another, hurled with enough rage that her cheeks puffed out. 

He caught them both with the edge of his sword. 

She screamed in frustration. "Is it from Arais?" 

"Of course it's from Arais, Stefani, they literally invented enchantments." 

"You know they learned it from the Ehuians?" she asked. "Ehuians don't have mages, they _are_ magic. Every flake of skin, every drop of blood. They're batteries, built by the gods to power magic. Living repositories of power, just smart enough to collect their own power and store it for the gods." 

"Moonspit, Stefani, I don't know what superstitious nonsense you've been listening to, but magic doesn't make you a goddess."

"The gods are real, Stef. They walk the realms. That sword you've got?" She flung another fireball. "It glows violet every time I touch it with my magic." Three more. "Do you have any idea how much _power_ violet is?" She screamed the words. 

"Power doesn't make you a god," Burcad said. 
"You think mages are just people?" 

"Everybody's a person, Stefani, even monsters."

"You've killed more monsters than I ever have, Tom, where do you get off moralizing at me like this?" 

"I didn't kill _children_."

"Neither have I!" 

"I want to go home," [[Reriana]] started to cry. 

"Yeah, me too, kid," Stefani said. 

She sighed and walked away. 

It was too easy. The woman he'd married had never walked away from a fight like that. 

But as long as he had the sword, she couldn't fight him directly, and she knew it. 

"Come on, kid. We've got a lot of ground to cover." 

The sword could protect him from battle, but it wouldn't do a damn thing for traps, and for all Stefani's secrets, she was still a hedge witch. She had more than a few tricks for traveling through rough terrain — that, he could count on. 

* * * 

Burcad held Reriana's hand while they walked. She wanted to fly, but he didn't trust the terrain — more accurately, he didn't trust Stefani not to be lurking in the woods, waiting for an opportunity to toss some kind of magic net around the girl and haul her away. 

Invisibility was a tough trick for a mage, or piracy would have been even bigger problem than it already was, but Burcad wasn't taking chances. Not when everything around him was drenched in white and grey; she wouldn't need invisibility, just quiet and a color change. Good camouflage didn't much need magic at all. 

He'd learned that the hard way, $how?$ 



The snow beneath his feet got thicker. 

"If you won't let me fly, can we at least have better shoes?" Reriana said, childish resentment thick in her voice as she kicked at the snow. Being lighter, she didn't sink as deep, and he could tell she was impatient. 

[[2021.11.03a Snowshoeing is better than skiing]]

[[2021.06.28 Food Preservation#Powdered Cow]] — 

The fire smelled like pine, a distinctive enough smell to tickle the back of his memories, a different year and a different battle, of flaming arrows off the coast of Eggodh, fired not by pirates, but from the hands of some fool of a prince's dumbass army of teenagers would-be despots. 

At least most of the pirates he'd come across shared their loot and didn't suffer fools to lead them. 

Not that the prince's strategic idiocy had done Burcad or his crew a damn bit of good — when it came down to the thick of things, sailors lived and died by tactics, and sails had a nasty tendency to burn faster than dry tinder. 

"Get me that brown bag we got in Lnigh, please," Burcad asked Reriana. "It's in the botBurcad of the pack."

She had brightened with every league %% [[units of measure]] %% they climbed — still pale, but the crystalline translucence of an ice sculpture, not the cloudy-grey of weakness.

Reriana may have been surprisingly well-read for a girl still too young to run with the wharf-rats and guild brats, but she didn't have a fine appreciation for all the ways this little adventure could go wrong. 

Tom, unfortunately, did. He knew precisely how badly a small bout of frostbite had ruined old man's life, and he could

Reriana screamed. Burcad shot to his feet, and damn the knee, sweeping up his sword and stumbling in the direction of her voice before he even managed to focus his eyes on her inhuman form. Her wings were flared, the blanket she'd wrapped them in to keep off the cold fallen to the ground

* * * 

The old man's fingernails were like thick, wide claws, oval with no cuticle, raised and longer than Burcad had ever seen on a man — not past the end of the finger like a lady's might be if she painted them according to the whims of fashion, but long int he skin, the whole knuckle longer than anything he'd ever seen before in a sailor.

%% "The Giver" esque ending scene, in which they collapse but get rescued. %% 

Burcad collapsed in the snow, his bum knee burning like fire. 

[[Reriana]] tugged urgently, impotently, at his sleeve. "You can't sleep here," she said. "You'll die."

At the moment, hypothermia sounded like a better end than forcing his depleted body to move another step. Reriana didn't deserve to be failed by another adult, though, so he dredged up the broken remnants of a smile. "Something you read in a book?" 

"Don't make fun of me," she snuffled primly in her piping voice. "It isn't nice." 

Lords and their crowns. "When did I ever give you the idea that I was nice?" he managed. 

She smacked his sleeve, which was covered in so many layers he barely felt the touch. "Don't make fun of yourself, either." 

"Sorry, kiddo." He took a deep, searing breath of too-thin, ice-laden air and levered himself into sitting up. His vision stuttered halfway through the motion, but Reriana helped keep him semi-vertical. 

"You need to stand up and keep moving," she said, face full of big, serious eyes. 

"Soon," he promised. "Just let me catch my breath." 

* * * 

"I'm going to go get help," Reriana said. 

"No, wait, I'll be okay," Burcad said, knowing it was a lie. She was better off if she left him — and if she left him, he could die in peace. 

She shook off the blankets protecting her wings from the wind. 

He didn't know if it was safe. Didn't know anything about Ehuians, really, other than how to make them die. A knife through the ribs. 

How many Ehuians had he killed? He didn't know. He didn't want to add Reriana to that uncountable list. 

Clenched his fingers in the snow, tried to force his old body to its feet. The muscles didn't so much as disobey as fail utterly to respond. 

He felt her drag him onto the tarp that served as the base of their tent. He tried to scrabble his feet, at least to help — what if she hurt herself, trying to move his ridiculous bulk? — but managed only to kick weakly. 

She patted his shoulder. "It's okay," she said. "You're going to be okay." 

He watched her fly away. Knew there was nothing else he could do to help. 

He smiled faintly, the shift in position agonizing on bitter-cold frozen skin. He'd done his best to help. 

* * * 

I think this is a reasonable place to end the story, then we can pick up with Reriana for a new story? 

* * * 

For the first time in her young life, Reriana flew. Really, she glided. Her wings were too weak for anything else. But as she scaled [[Kortien Mountain]] in search of the people who had concieved her — hoping they hadn't abandoned her on purpose, hoping they would help her, hoping that Burcad wouldn't die before she could find help, hoping that Burcad wouldn't be the only person in the whole world who ever helped her — she could at least leap 

It was a guilty thought, to be glad that Burcad had finally weakened enough that she could move on without him, but she _was_ grateful, she was, she couldn't have made it to the mountains without him, but she knew _he_ couldn't _climb_ the mountain without _her_ — someone like her, because she was too little. 

She practiced flying by accident, at first, when she came to a cliff she saw no way to avoid, and didn't know how to climb, not without Burcad and his ropes and pinions and years of experience rigging sailing ships she'd never seen. She tried anyway, and when she fell, her wings caught her, though she nearly landed badly and rolled her ankle. 

She practiced flying in little fits and starts, launching herself off jagged rocks, knowing that if she broke a leg she would die here, but knowing too that if she didn't try, she'd never make any progress at all, not with all the _up_ she had to go. 

* * * 

- [ ] this is a good story to ask Ari for help with, heh. She's good with stuff from little kid perspectives. 

* * * 

A shadow crossed her hands, bringing with it cold deeper than she'd yet experienced. She'd kept to the sunny spots because even for her, the mountains were cold, though for once she could finally breathe. The air, crisp and clean, sat in her lungs like a lemondrop, clearing out the thick, heavy weight of the lowlands. 

"HELP!" she screamed, louder than she'd ever screamed in her life. 

The lump in the air kept flying. 

She screamed again, and launched herself into the air, flapping as hard as she could, but it was no use. She cried. 

The shadow came back. The lump in the air wheeled around. Got bigger. 

[[Reriana]] wiped her eyes with the heels of her mittens and tried again to launch herself into the air. She strained, and got a little higher.

The lump landed.

An Ehuian man sat on its back. His 

Reriana stared. She stared at everything, memorizing every detail, committing his features to memory, the shape of his hands, the way he held his wings, the downy way his feathers were braided. 

He said something she didn't understand in a high-pitched, booming language she didn't understand. She wanted to cry; she'd finally found someone who looked like her and she didn't even know how to talk to him. 

His brow furrowed, eyes going cloudy. 

"Do you understand me?" he asked, and those words she knew. 

"Help me!" she said. 

"Where do you come from? Who are your people?" 

"There was a cellar, in Elford, and a woman, and then a man named Burcad brought me to—"

"Elford!" the man exclaimed. "But how—" 

"The woman says I hatched there, but the man, Tom, he brought me—" 

"Hatched? Ehuains don't hatch from— oh, Realmwalker." He swept her into his arms, arms up under her wings and elbows tight around her waist, holding her aloft so firmly that even when she wriggled she couldn't _move_. She felt his breath in her feathers. 

"Burcad needs help," she said into his shoulder, but the words were muffled by his leather cloak. 

- [ ] THIS is the avalanche. The avalanche should go over Tom's tent. Later they'll have to dig him out.
