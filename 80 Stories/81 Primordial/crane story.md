The idea being that it's the sensational but sort of nice side story of a guy who falls in love with a werewolf would make a neat little flash fiction story for a magazine, like diabolical plots that enjoys funny framing stories.

I really lean into the conservation angle and have tweets to some of the tweets be about how sad it is that the werewolf doesn't know that the human is a conservationist. Talk about the guy's like real life wife. Do it with some kind of markdown threading style and bonus points if we can include food in there because the food mating ritual thing would work really well for this. There's the whole idea that werewolves, meet with food rituals that you can riff off of Ilona Andrews, which we know the [[Kel Coleman]] likes so I think this is a better choice for the diabolical plots window.

- [I] interviewee #1 (the zookeeper) keeps making statements like "she can talk" but the journalist treats it like a "bird tells me what she needs" kind of thing, not like a werewofl is a sentient being. The main interviewee is the zoo manager "wow yeah lars is so good with her..." kinds of stuff.
