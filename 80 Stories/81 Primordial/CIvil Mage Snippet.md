The doctor took one look at her and sneered, which gave Irella a hint at why the tent was so empty; no one wanted to be treated by an $asshole$.  

"This tent is for soldiers only," the doctor said. 

A lazy $asshole$, at that. 

Irella supposed that technically, he was correct. Neither she nor her _biladiyn_ were officially part of the army. It had never mattered before; when she campaigned with Eramepi, nobody would have dared turn her away. But she didn't know where else to turn--medicine was not the purview of the gods. %% See: [[2022.04.27 The Apothecary's Daughter (MF)]] %%

%% Note: 
The idea here character-arc wise is that she's used to everyone working on the same team, and hasn't run up against bureaucratic nonsense anymore. This is the niave --> savvy thing. %%

When she met with the governor in the previous scene: "You're choosing to follow orders," Governor said sadly. 

This lampshades the issue that she's following orders instead of breaking them to do what's right. Thematically I'm setting up a story about how all the bureaucrats who served the Trump administration missed an opportunity. Specially Pence! 

IRella's arc is as a child to politics. Eramepi was her patron, and looked out for her. But "He did you no favors by keeping you so close. You're like a babe in the woods, for all your brilliance, Irella."
