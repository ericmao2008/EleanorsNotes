5k or less short story from the pov of a non male character in Greek myth. Consider Hestia the conflict avoidant, set it up like she's happy to get out of a "high prestige" recurring meeting. Do some research to find out what she does with the rest of her time. Meets up with Hera a bunch to collab on childcare and marriage stuff, I bet. Comfort Hera about the hypocrisy of being the goddess of marriage when her marriage is such a mess. Would be a neat conversation. The subtext being that Hestia keeps everything together and functioning, solid source of quiet advice, the conflicts are all convincing other gods to do their jobs. How does she display power? Telling Dionysus to GTFO of the homes she watches over. No alcoholics in happy homes, do that shit in festivals, sirrah. He thinks she's weaker than him because she ceded a seat at Olympus. He's wrong!
