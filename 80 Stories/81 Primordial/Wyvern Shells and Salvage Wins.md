- [i] Outline
	- Era: [[Temple Mage]]
	- Protagonist: Jibben is a fisherman. 
	- Goal: Hunt the wyvern, they're super valuable.
	- Conflict: The Imazi try to warn him off. 
	- Disaster: The wyvern destroys his weapon. 
		- Does he find it? (Find what?) 
			- No, and the Imazi warn him off. 
			- No, but he finds an egg nest, and the eggs are very valuable. 
	- Twist: The wyverns hatch and eat all his fish before flying away. He was hanging out waiting for the Wyvern mama? 
	- End: He salvages the egg shells, having learned nothing. 
	- Theme: Gambler reference. He lost more than he gained, but is convinced that he "won." 

Jibben nearly capsized his skiff the first time he saw a wyvern. The horse-sized reptile rising in the distinance with a cry of outrage so shrill it silenced the riverside birds.
