The general idea is that it should _feel_ like a cattle rustling story, but really be more of a "march lords" style border war for land and territory. Riffs off of [[2022.04.06 Haze (MF)]] thematically in some ways, but more "country" in feel. This might be a good candidate for [[Freelance copywriters]] to do, once I get the worldbuilding notes built out. The exemplar can be [[2021.07.21 Cat and Wolf (FF)]].
