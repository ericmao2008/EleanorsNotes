- [I] Delilah in Verraine. 
	- Need a good analogue to his hair.
	- Samson's first lie should be about the cauldron. What about the second lie? Third time she asks, she uses a truth serum / spell, not just pillow trick. Add in more spy tricks to make Delilah come across more like a brilliant spy. 
	- A big chunk of the OG Delilah's success depended on Samson being really dumb and arrogant. That won't work here (it's an overdone take) but I can make him smarter in order to give Delilah more challenges to overcome. 
	- What if Samson is a _Swordwulfen_? 

Delia didn't stop washing the madder root when the magi came to Redbrook. The town had been named for the quality of its famously vibrant exports; madder grew unusually well there, and the cold hill stream was perfect for setting dyes.

They swept in as the sun had just began to set, when the skies over Redbrook painted the river crimson bright, flushed with victory and demanding wine. Since Redbrook was a mid-size town, there was of course wine to be had — and song, and women. 

Perhaps if the Ellijorn Province had a single soldier left unburied, they might have even paid for it. 

Instead, Delia found herself unceremoniously lifted from the dye vat she'd been grimly determined to keep processing in hopes that the soldiers might dismiss her for being mottled and bent-backed and more importantly busy creating the very products Redbrook was famously able to export in exchange for wine and beer and singers and prostitutes. 

Instead, they tied her to the saddle of a [[fyrpwny]] beside the biggest, smelliest [[Swordwulfen]] in the magi army. Too big to ride a regular warhorse, or even one of the winged [[tulpi]] from the mountains, the magi had been forced to conjure a beast from the aether and they had made no attempts to make the creature seem friendly. 

Though its flesh didn't burn her, it was not hot to the touch, like a mug tea first turned drinkable. 

- [i] obviously "Samson" is the Swordwulfen. 
- [!] Need to figure out where in the [[Timeline of Verraine]] this fits. 
- [?] What kinds of secrets might "Samson" have that she could reveal? Who does she spy on behalf of?

"Why are you bringing me along for this?" she asked, anguished, as he held her wrist and led her away from the bleeding boy. 

"Hush," he told her absentmindedly as they stepped inside the next tavern. He gave her wrist a warning squeeze. 

Inside the tavern, Delia's sister Korie stood behind the bar. She'd married the keeper three years prior, and her eyes burned with hatred when she saw the Swordwulfen's grip on Delia's wrist. Still, neither of them said anything. 

Better if none of their new ==rulers? oppressors? conquerors? occupiers?== knew that they were related. Perhaps then no one would try to use them against the other. 

"What do you want me to do?" Korie asked, sounding tired. 

The Swordwulfen grunted ==describe the unique characteristic, something like "his black and hairy eyes darting around the room" or whatever, #fic/crossreference with [[2021.11.03 The Impossible Knife (SS)]] to find something appropriate==. "How many rooms do you have?" 



"Eight," Korie said. Delia knew damn well that Korie and her husband had ten rooms for rent, and Delia wanted to scream at her sister not to risk angering the Swordwulfen, but she bit the inside of her lip and said nothing.  

It didn't matter. Somehow, he knew Korie was lying. His tone took on a dangerous depth. "How many?" 

Korie didn't so much as flinch. "Eight rooms available." 

"I didn't ask how many rooms were _available._" Swordalpha said flatly.

The dullness in Korie's eyes was as much a lie as her earlier words had been. Delia wondered who she had been trying to protect. "We have ten rooms, but one is my daughter's and—"

"An barkeep's daughter is not more important than—"

"—and she's pregnant!" Korie continued, her voice going just a little shrill as she rode right over Swordalpha's words. "You people killed my husband, and my son, and if you move her now, you're going to kill my daughter too, you absolute monster of a man." Her voice broke. 

Delia couldn't help herself. "You promised would send her into the mountains!" 

Korie glared at her sister. "So she can labor on the road, alone?" 

Delia bit her lip. Korie could have gone with her. Korie's father had family in the mountains, and though the mountianfolk were famously hostile to refugees, not even they would have turned away a woman heavily pregnant with one of their own scions. 

- [!] this frankly doesn't make sense, #fic/editPending 

"Enough," Swordalpha growled. "I will send for a healer mage, and when the girl finishes her birthing, you will clear out the room for my men." 

Korie's face stayed flushed with outrage, but she gave a curt, abrupt nod.

"You know her," Swordalpha said after they had left the tavern.

"I know everyone in Redbrook," Delia said. 

"You know her enough to care about her," Swordalpha corrected. 

Delia kept her tone from going tart with an effort of will. "I care about everyone in Redbrook." She worked hard to sound like an earnest, kindhearted milkmaid, and not the bitter old spinster she felt like. 

She _did_ care about everyone in Redbrook; especially the widows whose husbands and sons this monster had killed, perhaps personally. She wanted nothing but the best for them; safety and health and enough food to last the winter.

Three days later the rest of the army joined them. They made camp on the edge of the dark wood, and then they left, and the Swordwulfen offered her a plate of cheese. 

"It comes from a city very far away," he rumbled, and she knew she was meant to be flattered and impressed that he was offering such expensive, exotic fare. Despite the meanness of their surroundings, he had clothed her in [[yhaoginli]] silk, and she had been given a hot bath with soap so fine it smelled of nothing. 

The swordwulfen, she was told, preferred natural scents. 

He was not a mage. Not a general. Not even fully human, if her guesses were right. 

"How do you come to have so many fine things?" she asked, expecting him to be angry but knowing she could not do her duty to _anyone_ if she did not understand. 

"I am the alpha," he said. 

"I don't know what that means," she said. Let him rage — let him cuff her, as she'd seen him do to one of the other soldiers in the army more than as he patrolled the city, dragging her along as though she were one of the ribbons pinned to his broad chest — but she would still be better off with the knowledge, if only he deigned to give it to her.
