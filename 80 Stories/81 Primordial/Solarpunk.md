I should write a solarpunk story for [[Solarpunk Magazine]], since it's a pro rate market and the [[GeneE]] universe has a fair amount of that kind of stuff. 

It should takes the [[2022.01.05 The Magic of Marsh Protection (FF)]] story and turns the snapper into a genetically engineered monster and set it in a pre rebellion Preserve. 

Could also tie in the [[Peacekeeper]] story thread somehow -- maybe she stumbles across him and he rescues her and she leaves the technocracy BEFORE she assassinates someone?

So instead of her needing extraction it's that she's landed and needs directions to the kill site. 

Could potentially be a cute little romantic story.
