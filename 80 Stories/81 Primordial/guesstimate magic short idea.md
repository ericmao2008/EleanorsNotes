Magic is cast from an energy pool, and you don't know how much energy it will take before you cast it. The energy is determined based off of how much the changes to the world you make affect destiny. It's the butterfly effect but you don't know beforehand what kind of impact, the butterfly wings will have. Because of this magic is kind of a gamblers thing where the gambler will charge based on what they think will happen. They either win or lose. The energy is taken on a siphoned basis so they become much more tired. Until the majors who have done the most are the ones who are basically hospitalized in homes for the rest of their lives.
