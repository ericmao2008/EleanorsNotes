- [?] What kinds of early triumphs shaped Arminia? 
- [I] Hansel and Gretel themed story about Arminia & Flavia's childhood.

Even as a child, Flavia was uncommonly good with animals. She had just the right tough with the milking and always seemed to fly through the spring shearing. 

Her sister Arminia, by contrast, hated the smelly beasts that shared her family's house, always bleating, always underfoot. One of the dogs that were forever ==dogging== at her heels had bitten on the ankle when she was young and even now she limped. 

Getting rid of the animals wasn't an option, of course

- [!] "Be careful what you wish for" flash isn't my thing normally, thematically I think it's a bit boring and condescending / sanctimonious, but it's slightly better when someone's attempt to convince another person that the grass isn't always greener succeeds. But it's hard to imagine doing that in an engaging way.
