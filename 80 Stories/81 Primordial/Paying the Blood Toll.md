- [I] I could have a story about a bridge where normal people don't have to pay anything. It is sustained by magic and may just have to pay it. There's a toll booth and a toll keeper and usually majors avoid going over it because it's actually quite painful. And this has the added bonus of being one of the ways they keep mages from traveling very much and leaving the realms. this is basically the Rainbow Bridge concept between worlds because it takes magic to sustain the bridge. But also the bridge is magic and for mages it's disproportionately harder for them to do cross. They still have to travel sometimes, enough that sustaining the bridge is possible. 


Jaqie tried not to flinch as the bridgekeeper jabbed a needle into her forearm and collected a vial of blood. 

"I always thought it was just a metaphor about how the bridge was paid for in blood," she said. Wars had been fought over this hill for generations â€” her great-grandfather had died defending the town from raiders nearly fifty years ago. 

"No," said her companion, a handsome mage she still couldn't believe she's been lucky enough to be hired by. "Most people with any power avoid the bridge if they can." 

"I guess part of the point of building the toll both is that we can't always avoid the crossing."

He offered a crooked half smile. "That, and there's power in blood and bone and flesh and hair that many people don't realize. Not everyone with power realizes they have it, especially if they aren't noticed or trained when they're young." 

He stared at her closely. She didn't know how to respond.

"They'll take blood from everyone 


- [B] They don't have to bridge they don't have to worry about determining whether or not someone is really a mage really has power. They can have the toll keepers be regular people, and then just sweep through periodically and collect the tolls and sift through it. Why don't their majors refuse to use the bridges? The bridges are useful. Most of the power we contribute really does go to maintaining them but every now and then you get somebody like this jerk thinks he can push it just a little bit farther. And then we're given a choice, we can just stop using the bridge. Instead spread the word about that, because it's not like we don't talk to each other. But then the people who can't protect themselves are affected. So we come out and we put a stop to it. I gave him three chances to not be evil. Before I kill him Don't you think that's a little brutal? A woman died because he took too much of just giving her but what he was owed. There's an opportunity here for white collar crime metaphor. I think that's going to be the theme of this
