Only Anna could sense the oncoming group of raiders. She felt them in her mind as easily as the honeysuckle against her skin. The earth compressed where they placed their feet. Branches bent where they brushed against the trees. She experienced it with the same clarity as the warbling love songs of the local finches, without any of the joy it should have brought. 

Mud caked her tunic and trousers, rendering the linen stiff and smelly, but the damp gully was the best place for an ambush in the pass. She was too focused on readying her magic for the enemy's approach to dwell on her fear. Her heart pounded anyway. The spell burned within her, threatening to explode past the confines of her control. Her husband must have sensed the danger, because Jeremy reached over and squeezed her knee. Half-dried dirt crumbled to the ground, and with a rueful smile he carefully wiped the mud off of his wedding band. 

Beside her, the blacksmith's boy shifted nervously. "What are we going to do if they know where we are, too?" he whispered. 

Anna shot him a quelling glance. "Admire their superior hearing," she hissed back. Though she empathized with his concerns, there was nothing to be done about them. The landsense gift was much rarer than even a talent for magic; they had to play the odds. 

Chagrin stained his cheeks, but didn't silence his voice. "But the baron--"

Jeremy reached behind her and cut him off with a quick cuff. "Shut up." His deep baritone was almost a growl. 

Anna suppressed a smile. She had always loved his knack for emphasis. 

Silence reigned for long, tense minutes while Anna tracked the enemy's approach. Eighteen men, each wearing worn uniform boots that signaled infantry, not poverty. But they walked with stumbling exhaustion instead of military precision, and  treated their mismatched weapons like toys instead of tools. She wasn't sure whether to hope they were hardened killers down on their luck or delinquent ruffians in search of opportunity. 

Jackals or wolves, she stifled her compassion. Between her father's death and last year's chestnut blight, the valley could barely support its own inhabitants. They wouldn't thank her for pity, and she couldn't afford to give them food.

Still, she planned to ask about those boots once she and her neighbors captured the raiders. 

She didn't dare doubt that they would. 

Finally, they came within sight of her position. Anna unleashed her spell.

A wave of green light stained the forest, trapping the raiders in a blanket of hardened air. Her people burst from cover. Launching themselves through the vines, they hurried to secure the scraggly youths with rawhide and lengths of rope. She stayed behind and forced herself to focus on fueling the spell with an even flow of power. 

For an instant, she thought she had somehow overloaded its delicate framework before she realized that the panicked spike of power hadn't come from her. The shock was emotional as much as physical. She swayed against the edge of the gully. Outnumbered and on the defensive, her magic was the only thing that gave the local farmers an edge. 

Losing that advantage seared her mind.

Anna shook her head sharply to force away the fading backlash of her broken spell. The sick sounds of pained grunts and dismayed cries came to her as she lay keeled over in the grass, gasping for breath. She imagined them as the squeals of slaughtered pigs on the farm to mask the twisting of her heart. The raids were becoming as common as the spring rains, in this part of the mountains. She should have expected something like this. 

Anna sat up and closed her eyes to block out the daystars obscuring her vision. 

"There's the witch!" shouted the man who, to judge from his fiery aura, had shattered her spell. He stood a little back from the rest of the raiders, the extra weight of him dug into the soft ground. 

Her husband spun. "Anna!" 

The unnecessary warning alerted only their enemies to his headlong rush to her side. One turned to face him. 

Jeremy slid to a stop, knuckles white around the hilt of his machete. 

"No!" Anna screamed, forcing herself to her feet. If she had only stayed still—but no, she was committed to action now. Options flew through her mind. The melee was too mixed for hastily adapted threshing spells. Fire would make the forest a death trap for them all. 

She stood frozen with indecision.  

Jeremy's eyes flew wide with panic as he realized his mistake. 

Unconsciously, she mimicked him. Helpless, Anna watched a sword skewer her husband with all the indignity of culling season and none of its efficiency. 

There wasn't time to react. Three men, barely past their last growth spurt and gangly with remembered youth as much as hunger, sliced their way through the last of the vines she had crouched behind. They hesitated, unprepared to strike her down in cold blood. 

"Kill her!" shouted the raider witch, and she wondered why he hadn't crafted another spell. "Before she kills us all!" 

Hysterical laughter bubbled up. She hadn't ever killed anyone before.

The youths recoiled from her, reacting instinctively to her madness. As she saw the fear in their eyes blossom, she regretted her past restraint.  They *should* be afraid. 

Anna shaped her magic, sucking power from her aura as smoothly as an indrawn breath. A deep green scythe swept through trees as neatly as necks, unstoppable. Thick trunks came crashing to the ground, the thuds a sharp counterpoint to the horrified screams of the raider witch who witnessed her wrath. He turned and fled, footfalls muffled by the soft ground, and she ached to chase him down.

Instead, she stepped over the corpses between her and Jeremy. Blood seeped through the fingers he held clenched over his wound. If she were a mender, she could stitch the wound, heal him. Instead, she could only stare, helpless. 

"It's okay," Jeremy whispered, his face white with pain. The sound of someone vomiting faded in the shadow of her guilt. "If I hadn't—"

"Not your fault." He hissed out a shallow breath as he struggled to breathe. Her own lungs felt too big for her chest. 

Anna stripped off her shirt and pressed it into his hands. "I don't know what to do." Her voice broke.

He offered the rictus of a smile. "It's too late to do anything, sweetheart."  

Tears blurred her vision, but she nothing could obscure her sense of the destruction she had wrought. It brought no comfort as her husband died at her feet. She wondered if their infant son would grow up to join his murderers; the orphan gangs, the disinherited poachers, the thrill seekers. Would he, too, starve and steal his way across Verraine until some witch defending her land acted too late to do any good? 

Anna had never hated herself more. 

* * * 

Anna stared at the wall of her husband's kitchen, her eyes and throat raw from another night of crying. The tan stone of the exterior was hidden behind plaster and paint, the soothing sage a mocking reminder of her loss. The building was sturdy enough to stand for centuries if given the barest bit of care. It felt so empty she could scream. 

"You need to eat," Sara said, her voice gentle as she set a bowl of soup on the small table before her daughter. "Jeremy wouldn't have wanted you to starve to death, and there's Duran to think of. You won't be doing him any favors by wasting away. Too many people have already died." 

Anna made no move to pick up the wooden spoon. The smell of her favorite soup twisted her stomach. "Jeremy is dead, Mother. It doesn't matter what he wants." 

"Of course it does, sweetheart. This can't go on." The baby began to cry. Sara's silvered braid swayed like a metronome as she walked over to his crib and picked him up. She patted his bottom and said, "He's hungry."

Anna stifled her resentment. Duran didn't know his father was dead. She stretched out her arms and took her son. 

Sara offered a satisfied nod. "He needs his mother." 

Almost by rote, Anna pulled a breast through the low neck of her tunic and lifted Duran to her nipple. "He needs to grow up in a better world."

"If you wanted enough power to change the world, you should have stayed at the Duke's school for witches." Her tone was as tart as rhubarb pie. "Your magic is strong."

"I didn't exactly quit," Anna reminded her mother wearily. "They kicked me out for blowing up the lighthouse." 

"You could have been a Lady if you had tried a little harder."

"Instead of married to a lowly farmer?" She glared, then closed her eyes and tried to force her emotions under control. Feeling numb had been easier, but the old argument slid out anyway. "It's not as though we're destitute, Mother. We have the land. You don't need a castle and a title to be important." 

"A castle and guards would have been safer." Sara huffed, the loose skin under her chin wiggling with the motion. "Your father was a farmer, Anna, and I loved him very much, but look where it got us."

"Widowed and alone," she answered bitterly. The two of them couldn't handle the farm on their own. "But that's not because they were farmers." 

"Isn't it?" Sara waved her off with a wrinkled hand, dismissing the topic with a sigh. "I'm sorry. I just wanted better for you."

Anna looked at the downy crown of her suckling son's head and bit back a sharp retort. She didn't want to argue anymore. "It will be for him."
Something in her tone must have telegraphed her seriousness. "What are you going to do?" Sara went over and stirred the pot of soup at the hearth, though it didn't need doing. With her back turned, she added, "You have more options than I ever did."

Anna laughed sourly. "What options? I never mastered my magic the way the others at that damn school did. Every time I tried, the spell blew up in my face. What can I do that you couldn't?" Landsense hadn't saved Jeremy. It wouldn't save her son. 

Sara had become more patient as she aged. A comment like that would have earned Anna a slap a decade ago. Now, Sara only turned back around. "You didn't answer my question." 

Anna shifted her son to the other breast. "I could probably create some kind of guard spell, something to keep people out of the valley the way Bo Miller keeps mice from the granary." 

"And when we need to trade for tools? For clothes? The valley isn't self-sufficient. Nowhere is." 

"Maybe that's the problem. These raids... if those boys had food and somewhere to live, this wouldn't be happening."

"Raids have always happened, Anna. Not this bad, maybe, but everybody wants something, even when they have more than they need." Her voice took on a higher pitch. "'The raids won't stop as long as one petty border lord will supply poor, angry boys with just enough hope to land them in trouble.' That's what you told me when you joined that sorry excuse for a militia last year."

Anna flinched at the cruelty of the reminder. "You begged me not to."

"You had to," Sara said with a pitiless disregard for her sense of guilt. "Those brats were killing people on their own front porches." 

Anna tightened her grip on her son. "I won't let that happen to Duran. He's all that's left."

"Then what are you going to do? Kill all of the raiders between here and the duchy?"

"Butchering my way across the continent will only terrify the people I'm trying to help. I'm not a monster." She remembered the sickly scent of vomit, and hoped it was true. "I'm going to recruit them."

For the first time, Sara looked startled. "And do what with them? Even with Jeremy gone, you can't put them all to work on the farm. The neighbors won't stand for it." She shook her head. "Anna, they killed your husband." 

"I will use them to conquer every homestead and barony from here to the sea if that's what it takes to stop this nonsense. The Lords have their guards, but they're selfish. They aren't thinking big enough." Her son stopped suckling and looked up at her. She smiled and lifted him to her shoulder to burp. 

"Big enough?" An element of panic entered her mother's voice. "You aren't even a Lady."

She summoned emerald fire to dance along the tips of her fingers. Duran gurgled happily at the display. "I could have been."

"Even if you get those boys follow you, the Lords will never stand for it."

Her eyes went hard. "They won't have a choice."

* * * 

Anna didn't like taverns. They always seemed to smell like moldy oats and vomit, and the prostitutes had a habit of pointedly ignoring her that she found grating. Still, there was no better place to find a group of dissatisfied youths, so she left Duran at home with her mother and walked to the local bar.
