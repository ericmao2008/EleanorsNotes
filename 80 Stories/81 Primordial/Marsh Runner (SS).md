This is [[Chaghalka]]'s arrival to [[Arais Delta]]. 

* * *

When warships dripping with magic and men slipped up the delta's only river, Toby didn't so much as fumble his fishing line. The port at Ulmes had withstood invasions before, swamp rats fading into the marshes while sophisticated traders plied flattery mastered over long centuries playing both sides to the benefit of the middle. 

It wasn't worth missing a meal over. 

The Delta was hot, and dirty, and full of biting bugs and toothsome beasts strong enough to snap a man's back with barely a sweat, but Ulmes was the _only_ deepwater port on the whole damn island, so none of Toby's fellow swamp-rats were what anyone sane would call poor. 

They certainly weren't stupid. 

After the ship passed, Toby reeled in his line, which — to his complete lack of surprise — had long since had its bait nibbled to shreds. Toby stripped the lash shreds of flesh off the bone hook and stowed the pole at the bottom of his canoe, a beautiful work of art his grandfather had carved nearly a hundred years ago. 

Then he untied the stern from the tree he'd snuggled up to and tossed the rope beside his rod. He had no intention of actually trotting the trot line he'd strung out into the middle of the river, along no matter what his grandfather had called the damn thing, but slid a net under it with the ease of long practice and let the current take him. 

It took deft hands, line in one hand and net in the other, to catch the bony crustaceans the Ulmes traders prized for their mustardy flesh and their glittering shells, but Toby had been fishing the Delta since he was hardly out diapers. 

When a snapper's beaked face slid up out of the water, firmly attached to the bit of bait tied to the line, Toby hardly broke rhythm as he swatted it with the rim of the net. The snapper slid back down into the murky depths and Toby scooped up another bit of dinner. 

He hummed to himself as he checked the rest of his traps, then headed off to Ulmes. 

He planned to sell the catch to the ship's captain at a cut-rate price. 

He'd never met a sailor who didn't desperately want something _other_ than fish as soon as he hit port. 

* * * 

There hadn't been a battle, of course. Ulmes didn't have a wall, or an army, or a navy, or a militia, or much of anything really. It was a collection of rotting wooden huts in the middle of a swamp. 

The Fontenanara River was a beastly mistress, but she was the only lover Toby wanted. He'd watched six brothers marry as well as could be expected from dock rat swamp kids and not one of them seemed happy drowning in mouths to feed and hair to comb and brats to bathe. Old Toby, oldest of the bunch and the least patient by far, wanted no parts of the the dance that had taken the rest of his family. 

No, he was content to spend his days trotting up and down a line of bait, knotting lines and burying traps and dodging snapping turtles the size of his chest. 

- [!] The conqueror doesn't even bother conquering Ulmes after he figures out that Ulmes isn't defended by anything other than the knowledge that only the swamp-rats can navigate it. Kill them and you're trapped. Of course someone could destroy it anyway, but at any given time only a small percentage of inhabitants live there, and then you're trapped, and they wait you out, and you starve. So the conqueror (a mage!) travels farther inland, and has to rent a boat to do it, basically. Toby takes him on a canoe. But what about everybody else on the ship? They stay in Ulmes until they can charter boats too.  

"Tobin R. Verdigris," Toby said with his most mercantile grin. "The 'R.' is for 'reliable.'" 

* * * 

He half-expected to get murdered at the end of the trip. But he couldn't quite turn down the lure of money, and figured what the hell. He was a 50 year old swamp rat with no kids.

A single leaf floated on the mosquito-infested water, sluggishly making its way south on its tea-brown sleigh. 

Toby watched as a dragonfly landed on the stem, two nymphs clinging to its back, and shook his head at the firmness with which the river did not change. 

"Why do you not use the pole?" the sailor asked, his accent heavy and awkward. 

Toby smirked. "The water's deeper than it looks, not that you could measure it. Ain't no bottom down there, just another ten rods of muck." 

The sailor rolled his eyes. "I could jump across this puddle of a fingerling, this is no river, it barely deserves to be called a stream." 

Toby bit his lip. "No one is stopping you from trying." He gestured toward a nearby tree, on which perched nearly a dozen bald vultures. 

One flared its black wings, as if to dare the sailor to test the river's virtue. 

"Watched a pack of baby snappers nibble a man down to bones before he hit bottom, once," Toby added helpfully. 

The sailor snorted. "Like you can see the bottom in this soupy mess." 

"It's more like tea, really. The sassafras leaves leech out into the water, you see, just like brewing a nice morning mug except it takes longer." Toby tossed the nub of his chew stick into the river and watched it float to the bottom. "You ever add cold water to a mugga and watch it swirl?" 

"...no?" 

"Enough," the captain said, sounding amused. "He means you can see the bottom when it rains. But I promise, if you try to stick your leg in there and swim, you'll lose three toes to snappers before you get knee-deep. I've seen it." 

The sailor subsided resentfully. 

"Snappers ain't so bad," Toby began.

"Enough out of you, too, marsh-man. I don't need you winding up my men. Just get us to Pontero. A bit faster, if you please." 

Toby grinned obediently and pulled out his boathook. "Can't pole with these depths, but might be able to pull us along if yon sailor lends his back." 

"Why does it have to be—"

Toby held up his hands defensively. "Nothing personal, sailor-man. But one of us pulling only works if one of us steers, and you don't know where we're going."

The sailor groaned. 

* * * 

Ulmes was a city of bridges and platforms built from half-rotted wood. Which half was rotted changed with the season, as work crews were forever bustling around the marsh to repair the bits that had finally succumbed to barnacles and suckling fish. Toby had done his time, as a youth, carefully repairing the sunken posts %% [[Chinampa Repair Story]] %% that formed the backbone of the city's artificial islands. 

Pontero, by contrast, was a city of stucco, bright colors almost riotously overwhelming to a man used to the shades of brown and green that dominated the Delta he called home. This far upriver, the water ran blue — and not the muddy blue of the ocean from the southern coast, no, this was sky blue.

And the sky! Toby couldn't remember the last time he'd seen so much sky all at once. The last time he'd gone to Pontero, on a trading trip with his youngest brother, had been the rainy season. There had been no sky then, only clouds, dark and dominant. 

The buildings along the wharf were huge, easily twice as tall as anything he'd seen built in Ulmes, and the biggest of them glittered red like the sunset. 

"Their priests build it out of aetherrock," the captain said. He didn't sound impressed. If anything, he sounded disgusted. "It's warm, and it's light, and it's strong, but it's _such_ a waste of magic." 

Magic. Toby knew magic. 

His sister-in-law's aunt had a bit of the gift. The old woman sold potions for maladies and %% relate to [[2021.07.28 Embaphium (MF)]] because this is probably where the sister got the knowledge from? %% had spent most of her life trying to figure out how to keep old people alive for just a little longer. She'd hired a [[Voldshee]] bodyguard, trying to learn the secrets of [[necromancy]] without actually leaving the marsh. 

- [!] What does she use it for? Riffing off of the swamp people in the Ilona Andrews book? Alchemy? Immortality potions and healing potions would make the most sense; after all this is where [[snapper]] populations spawn. 

She was convinced that if she left the marsh, she'd lose her magic, which sounded like nonsense to Toby, but who was he to judge? He was no mage. 

He just knew he didn't like visiting the old witch's house. It smelled like taxidermy. 

"What should magic be used for?" he asked politely as he poled his canoe up to the dock. Pontero docks were barely big enough to deserve the name; they huddled the shore, leaving the huge expanse of the river bare, which baffled Toby. In the Delta, docks sprawled into every available inch, floating platforms that tied up to one another like boats themselves. 

Not that Ulmes had anything like the kind of long, winding shoreline that Ulmes did. He'd forgotten how _big_ Pontero was. Ulmes was prosperous — it was the only port for a large island, and only its traders knew how to navigate the ever-changing channels in the marshlands — but there just wasn't that _space_, not with as much work went into keeping the island stable and how little else there was to earn a living from _but_ trade. 

"Pontero," Toby said triumphantly after he'd tied up to the dock, which, being driven into the sand below — he could see the bottom easily, see exactly how they'd done it, which would never _not_ feel weird, he could even see the little fishes hiding in the shadow of the poles — didn't so much as twitch as he tied off the knots. "As promised." 

The Captain grunted. "Excellent, Toby, thank you." He handed Toby a small bag of gems, which surprised Toby more than anything.


- [!] Ok, now something has to go wrong here. What's the twist? I like the idea of the Captain being the Conqueror. Does he just level the city with his magic? Lol. That would certainly get everyone's attention. Needs to be something flashy, for sure. Maybe he just topples the temples. 

He clambered onto the dock, crackled his knuckles, and waited for his men to join him. "Alright boys, let's get to work." 

* * * 

Toby saw no reason to turn around and immediately head back to Ulmes. He had money, and he was hungry, and he was curious. 

He'd just settled in against a stucco wall in a courtyard demarcating a big fountain area and was staring at the pool of perfectly clear water that people were _bathing_ in — how many moonfish would it take to get such an effect back in the water back home? How many linen sieves?
