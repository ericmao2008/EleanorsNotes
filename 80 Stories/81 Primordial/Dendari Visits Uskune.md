The horizon glowed like banked coals by the time Dendari reached Uskune. Dusk was later than he liked for dealing with Nahrian gate guards, but there was no help for it. Even with an apprentice to help with him to help manage the goats, skirting a rockslide cost a couple of hours. 

If it weren't for the nomad tribe camped outside the gates, he wouldn't have bothered making the trek down from his stead. Though he'd crossed the length and breadth of Maehlorn in his youth, these days he preferred to limit his travels. He was a married man now, with enough land to take care of a family and no need of adventure to fill his purse and feed his ego. 

"I hate cities," Bihotz muttered once they passed beyond the guard.

"Quiet," Dendari said, keeping his voice low. Normally, he didn't care if the younger man let off a little steam -- at that age it was practically a requirement for his mental stability -- but the mood in Uskune was... tense. Not ugly, thankfully, or he would have turned them back around and camped in the mountains, but the last thing either of them needed was to set off one of the local soldiers as they bristled from restricted tavern times and extra vigilance. 

Bihotz looked sideways in surprise. He hadn't sensed the frustration simmering in the air, probably didn't realize how many of the men they were walking past would have begged for an excuse to stab someone. 
Dendari had spent too long in the lowlands as a youth to miss the signs. 
Maybe it was a good thing he'd brought Bihotz. The boy had a swagger to him that served him well amongst his peers, but no amount of talent with an axe would save him from getting run through by a Nahrian sword. It was probably time he learned more about the lowlanders. They'd spent the last thirty years perfecting the art of war, sharpening their swords on their own people with their customary efficiency. 

It was no way to live, but thankfully, Dendari wasn't trying to embrace their lifestyle. He just wanted their coin. Or, more accurately, their grain. 
First, though, they needed lodgings. 

Uskune didn't cater to many travelers, being so far from the river that supported most of the eastern empire's trade. In truth it was a garrison town, though it had been brought into the Empire years before, and as much as soldiers enjoyed their entertainments, Uskune was pretty far north by Nahrian standards. Not many bards and merchants bothered to make the trip.

Still, there were a few options, and Dendari preferred The Foggy Pint despite the expense. The innkeeper always knew who was willing to buy medicinals at a markup, and the clientele didn't run to the soldiery. At his age, Dendari was willing to pay extra to avoid a brawl. 

Especially with Bihotz with him. 

Besides, it was one of the few places his goats were welcomed. Unlike the Tribes and the Voldshee, Nahrians didn't much care for animals. They tolerated the feral cats who roamed their cities for their abilities as mousers, and kept oxen for the cart and the plow, but he'd never met a Nahrian who so much as offered a beast a treat. 

"Let's unharness the goats," Dendari told his apprentice. “Then you can take them around back to the paddock and brush them while I deal with the travois." 

Goats were a lot smaller than Nahrian oxen, but Dendari wouldn't trade his small herd for the lowland creatures. Goats were smart, nimble enough to handle the uncertain footing in the mountains, and ate pretty much anything. Still, they couldn't pull as much, which meant it was quick work to disassemble the travois and stow the poles in the back of the Foggy Pint's woodpile. 

He doubted anyone would be able to identify it. His people didn't sell much uncut timber; it was too difficult to transport out of the mountains. What few samples of Voldshee woodworking was traded in the lowlands was expensive, delicate, and refined. Those items he kept on his person, carrying the sacks into the inn. Sadera recognized him and spared no time on chitchat beyond a reminder that his sword wasn't permitted in the dining hall. 

In short order he had his gear stowed in a room with a lock, one of the few quirks of the city he appreciated, and returned to the common room to claim a table. 

Light flashed near the back door and he turned, expecting Bihotz to emerge from the paddock. Instead, he saw a ghost. 

No. Barrow-wights were night creatures, creatures of the mountains. They came from the trees, called forth by the magic of a Voldshee necromancer on the sacred solstice, in response to a prayer. 

But -- she was Voldshee, as out of place in a Nahrian inn as he was, no matter how close to the foothills Uskune rested. Her chestnut hair was pinned back severely in the Nahrian style, but he could see the waves each lock made as they snaked across her skull, black in the shadows and gold in the light. That pointed chin, those severe cheekbones. 

Elixane. 

Impossible. Elixane had been dead for well over a decade. 

Her husband and daughter, too. All of them killed when their convoy had been raided by a band of Wessie rogues; it had been the tragedy that led him to start trading. 

Or maybe not. 

No, the wightwomen had recovered Elixane's body. He remembered; he'd been too far north to attend the funerary rites, but they'd been unable to raise her wight, to learn more. The body had been left in the lowlands too long. 

Had the daughter escaped? Been taken in by a Nahrian family in Uskune? 
It seemed impossible; he'd been traveling to the city for seasons now. Surely someone would have mentioned an orphaned Voldshee child to him. 
What had the child's name, been? He couldn't remember, which shamed him. Elixane had been as close as a sister to him, once. He owed it to her memory, if not her wight, to investigate her doppleganger. 

Dendari moved to intercept her; she noticed him moving toward her and turned toward him with a smile like a shopkeeper's: polite and a little hurried. "Are you the owner?" She spoke Nahrian with a mid-river accent, which surprised Dendari. Not the language itself; Uskune was a Nahrian city, albeit barely. But people in this quarter of town tended toward the polygot creoles of the border folk, and he'd spent enough time traveling in his youth to spot the difference, even if he couldn't mimic it. 
She correctly interpreted his surprise as a negative, and started to brush past him. 

"Wait," he blurted. "I knew your mother." 

She recoiled as if he'd struck her. Her dark eyes sharpened and for the first time he felt like she was actually looking at him. He didn't understand her horror, but it was plain on her face for the five seconds it took her to recover. Her face became a salesman's mask again and she said. "I don't talk about her. Excuse me." 

She turned around and headed back toward the door. 

He thought about following her, but realized in time that the gazes of the men around him were unusually alert. He suspected that if he went after a Nahrian woman who had clearly expressed her disinterest in talking with him, those faces would become openly hostile. 

Especially if he left without paying for his drink. Nevermind that his things were upstairs, or that Sadera trusted him. Men like these never assumed the best of a man--and on a different day, he might have joined them. 
Chafing at the delay, he returned to his table. 

Sadera returned with his beer. "What'd you do to you scare off that priestess?"  

Dendari stared into the golden liquid, so different from the brandy he drank at home. “I knew her mother, once. A long time ago.” He took a sip; he knew better than to trust the local water. For all the vaunted Nahrian technology, finding an unfouled well in the lowlands was usually impossible. 
“Ah,” Sadera said, with that knowing tone matriarchs used when they suspected a euphemism for sex. Nahrians had euphamisms for all sorts of things related to sex; they were by far the most repressed people on the island.  “Sometimes the past is best left in the past.” 

Dendari offered a crooked smile; she couldn’t have been farther from the truth in her assumptions, though he certainly wasn’t planning to explain his preferences to a Nahrian innkeeper. If for no other reason than to spare Bihotz their scrutiny; Nahrians could make the most insulting of assumptions when they were reminded of Voldshee marriage customs, and he didn’t know how he Bihotz would react to some of the more outlandish insults Nahrians could throw.

At least he had a clue to go off of. How many priestesses could Uskune have, after all?
