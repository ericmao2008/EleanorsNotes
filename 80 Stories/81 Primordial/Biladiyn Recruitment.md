"It's not a death cult, Mother," [[Iganmor]] said, rolling his eyes as he finished shoving his black scarf into a bag alongside every other piece of black clothing he owned. 

The dock smelled like rotten fish and old [[snapper]], but he was too excited to care. The $boat name$ was his ticket out of this muddy swamp town, and whatever his mother thought, the [[Order of the Hallowed Dakhma]] were good people. 

"It's a mercenary army filled with men that take their glory in dying for the cause, Iganmor. I don't want you dying for any cause, but certainly not in service to some foreign god who ain't never done nothing for us or ours." 

"Oh, for the love of [[moonfish]] pie. They're bodyguards, not ravening murderers."

"You need to paddle north to Nahria to guard a body? Stay home, keep your sisters safe, it's a good life, Iganmor."

"No, mama, it ain't," he said. 

- [!] why not? 

"'Sides, they're gonna train me to fight. I'm gonna see _miracles._"

She spat. "Miracles, pah. Whatever they call 'em upriver, it's all just magic. You want to see magic, you go catch a moonfish and take yourself on down to Mayribeth's hut and you ask her to cut it open. She'll show you magic, then."

"Ain't trying to spend my days watching old women cleanse wells, Mama. I want to make something of myself." 

She sniffed derisively. "You just don't want to your sister to be happy."

In point of fact, he did want Sattie to be happy, he just didn't expect it. Not with her planning marrying Kitrin Rois next week. 

Kitrin was a trader's son, tall and sleek and fat with prosperity â€” especially his fists, which had split open on Kitrin's jaw more than once growing up. 

"Last thing Sattie needs is me and Kitrin at the same table together every festival moon, Mama. You ask her and she'll tell you herself. I'm going."

He set off down the dock, which wobbled precariously under his feet. Delta-born, he didn't so much as tilt as he boarded the big northbound raft.

"It's a long way to Pontero," the Orderman said, setting his pole in the muck and pushing off. "Know any songs?"
