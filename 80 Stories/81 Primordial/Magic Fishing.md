- [!] Do not publish this anywhere family can see it, lol. This is based on a true story. 

Magic flung the boat out into the middle of the strait, the artificial wind of their passage whipping past. The water of the Strait was crystalline and placid under a sky doted with fluffy white clouds usually hidden from Catie's view by the thick trees of the Delta — or, if she were being honest, by the walls of the office where she spent her days juggling the accounts for a multinational trading consortium whose assets were so esoteric that she was often unsure whether her salary was even real.

She'd grown up on this boat, though, her very fine education financed mostly by the exotic fish her uncle was so skilled at caching, and it was great to be out under the sun for once, enjoying the nice weather. 

Uncle even let her drive. 

When he leapt up abruptly, she thought at first that one of the rods had hooked a fish — but no, there was none of the ripcord whine she associated with an unspooling line.

"Get up!" her uncle shouted, just as an enormous dark mass breached the surface and let out a terrifying roar. 

- [?] How to write this so it feels atmospheric and terrifying instead of matter of fact? My usual retellings lack tension because it's a punchline about dad and the dry rotted safey stuff — it's aobut the people. Need to bring that out more. 

"No," her father whispered in horror. "We killed them all."

"All what?" Catie asked, staring at the enormous beast in confusion. 

"All the shipbreakers." 

"What an ominous name." Catie's voice came out uncomfortably high pitched. Her body felt somehow far away. 

"Descriptive," her uncle said grimly as her father began frantically ripping into boxes. 

- [I] he's looking for weapons instead of life preservers. 

"Where the hell do you keep the harpoons?" her father snarled. 

Uncle jerked the boat around. It was a midsized-vessel, large enough to have a cabin and a toilet but small enough that all the beds were covered in fishing rods, and it cut nimbly through the water until the engine abruptly faltered. 

Her uncle reached out and grabbed her wrist with his weathered hands, dark and scarred against her skin. He hauled her hand down toward a small pocket under the helmmen's bench. "Climb up on the roof and see if you can't find us a reef, okay?" He sounded so calm. 

Her father was anything but. 

He pulled out a long wooden spear, half-rotted and so splintered as to be worthless. "Are you trying to get us killed?" he roared. "Not even you are so lazy as—"

Her uncle cut him off, still crisis-calm. "Replacement's in the cabin," he said. "Hold on." He hauled the boat around again. 

"We're taking on water," Catie reported, she refused to be scared, mostly because she didn't really understand what was going on. 

"You see anything moving in it?" her uncle asked. 

"Nooo," Catie said after 




"Do you want me to use my magic to—"

"No!" her father shouted. "Are you trying to get us killed?"

"If you had ever told me about any of this before maybe I could be more helpful!" Catie shouted back. 

"Hush," her uncle said. "Too late now, and we never thought it'd matter. Thought they were all gone."

"Obviously we were wrong," her uncle said. 

- [I] Is it possible to tie this into [[Iganmor]] somehow? Or [[2022.01.05 The Magic of Marsh Protection (FF)]] or one of the other [[snapper]] stories? Could the uncle be one of the kids who hunted them when young? Not sure, need to do some thinking, because "fast magic boats" is pretty far along in the storyline. 

"Obviously, or I never would have come out here with a mage-powered engine!" he snapped. 

"Or my daughter," Dad said. 

Without further discussion or any signal that Catie could see, they each threw their spears. 

"Go!" Uncle shouted, and Catie poured power into the engine — more than she ever had before. 

It choked, sputtered, and died. 

- [?] What now. This is a good try/fail cycle and honestly the sort of thing that has happened to me before, but what now? There's supposedly a giant snapper? Or what if it's an Ehuian! That feels easier to fight, honestly. And a little sadder when we get to "I thought we killed them all." 
- [?] If it's an Ehuian why are they attacking a random pleasure boat in the open sea? Are they starving? Not actually an attack they're collapsing trying to escape [[Eheu Isle]]. Why? Pursuing the rumor of the easterners. Need to send word that the invaders the Realmwalker was protecting them from have arrived. THE INVADERS ARE HERE is a great note to end on. 

"You said you killed them all," Catie said. "Why would they try so hard to warn you?" 

"One last petty trick to mess with our heads," her father said contemptuously as he kicked the corpse off the boat and into the water. "It was probably diseased." 

But Catie suspected that something else was responsible for the bulging belly, and for the first time in her life, felt afraid of her father.

- [!] This is not a good ending but it's a good hook / seed for another, longer story. 

As she helped stow the hidden arsenal, she tried to imagine what she would do if invaders really _had_ come through a secret tower on top of the world.
