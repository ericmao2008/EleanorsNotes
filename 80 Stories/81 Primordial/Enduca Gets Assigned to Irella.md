- [ ] Write the scene where Enduca gets assigned to Irella. Either do it flash fiction style or where her goal is to get Irella protected and she's 'punished' by being assigned to fella directly even though she's always guarded Engineers before this -- it's got to be kind of a punishment in a way that shows the internal religious schism that Irella represents because she helped with the conquest of the League. In this scene, make sure to: (via Laura) expand on what the *bilaydin* are. I think they are body guards for the priests and priestess's but I'm not sure. I'm also curious what the relationship between the priesthood and the government is. There seems to be some separation. Do all members of the League believe in the same gods.
