- [I] Start off with the soldier attacking the biladiyn "I'm here to help!" The biladiyn and the conqueror's army are old enemies who have basically been in an uneasy truce for the last decade or so. 

Jhordan had barred the door, but somehow there were footsteps upstairs. 

He readied his garrote and struck. 

"I'm here to help," the man shouted, holding up a mace to block the attack. It might have helped, but Jhordan spun quick enough that it didn't come to blows. 

He wore the ==Srinese uniform describe==. 

- [?] How did he get here? How do they settle their "differences" to get settled and start working together?

"It feels weird being on the same side of the door as you," Dierk said. 

"You're welcome to head back outside," Jhordan said.

Dierk snorted. "Mama only raised one fool and he's already dead."

"Sorry for your loss," Jhordan said automatically as he shoved his shoulder against the door from keep it from bursting open. 

The soldier shrugged. "Got what was coming to him, swimming in that damn Delta after the Captain told him not to." 

Jhordan winced sympathetically as they propped an armoire against the door. "Snapper get him?" 

Dierk snorted. "He shoulda been so lucky. Caught some kind of swamp fever and died screaming."

Jhordan couldn't bring himself to actually feel bad for the dead man, who had, after all, been coming to Nahria for express purpose of conquering the Basin for the glory of his bastard king, who had inherited control of the entire Plain of Srin and deemed it insufficient to his ambition. 

Which â€” wait a minute. Chaghalka hadn't left Maehlorn in over a decade. "Why'd you guys come to Maehlorn, anyway?" 

Dierk raised an eyebrow. "Boss told me to." 

"Same reason you're here now, helping?" 

"Boss said to stop the rioters."

"Do you even know _why_ they're rioting?" Jhordan asked, half-curious and half appalled. 

"Honestly, who cares? Anything that happens this fast can't possibly have a good reason for wrecking a whole city." 

Jhordan shoved his shoulder back against the door. "They think Chaghalka corrupted the Temple's Justice." 

"That why you're here?" Dierk asked. "To protect the Temple? I thought you guys only protected people." 

- [!] insert the spiel of the Biladiyn

"For a minute I thought you were gonna say you were here to kill me." 

"You came to me," Jhordan reminded him. "Besides, we don't kill mages." 

The soldier froze. "What _do_ you do?" 

"Aren't you curious how I knew you were a mage?" 

"To be honest, no. Mostly just be glad to make it out of here alive." 

"I'm here to recruit you." 

"Want to give me a new boss?" 

"Aren't you worried I won't stay bought?"

"Not trying to buy you. Just offering to teach you some tricks." 

"Not sure I want to learn from the guys who lost the war."

Jhordan grinned. "Did we? Temple's still standing. Taxes ain't changed much. Ain't many dying." 

- [!] What does it mean to win? Wars are won in the hearts of men. Cross-reference with [[The Dead King's Daughter]]. That which bends is not always weak. 

"Of all the times to recruit, you picked the middle of the worst riots this city has ever seen?"

"I don't like to miss opportunities." He opened the door, falling into old guard habits as he checked it and then hurried the soldier through. "Besides, riots ain't much compared to battle, and we recruited then too."

- [I] Introduce him to his brother, lol, not actually dead because the swamp people rescued him and sent him off to the biladiyn for healing.
