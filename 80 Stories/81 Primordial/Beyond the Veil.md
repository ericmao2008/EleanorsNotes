Five words were all I had left of my brother: *Tal has fallen. Don’t return.*

As a warning, it was clear. 

In every other way, the message was useless. The messenger, even more so. 

“What do you mean, you don’t know?” I demanded, though I knew it wasn’t fair. Though Evander hadn’t inherited our mother’s magic, he’d gotten a full measure of our father’s glower. If Evander had told this boy to run, I shouldn’t blame him for obeying, swiftly and exactly. 

*Shouldn't* was a far cry from *wouldn't.* 

My brother’s apprentice swallowed. “He sent me away before the rebels breached the wall. I didn’t see—” 

“Of course you didn’t."  I sighed. "What's your name, boy?”

"Arion, sir." It was the shame in his eyes that did me in; he had no more wanted to abandon the city than I wanted my brother to be dead.

I didn't need an eyewitness report to be sure. If Evander had sent away his apprentice, then all hope was lost. He would no more have abandoned his post than I would sprout wings and cross the Sea of Songs. 

If our family had a virtue, it was *duty,* and my duty here was clear: Evander wouldn't have sent the boy to me if he didn't need looking after. 

“What am I to do with you?” 

He looked startled. "Sir?"

*Gods beyond the veil, why me?* "When was the last time you ate?"

"I've seen you before. Beside the Mantelaine at her coronation."

"Why are you here? Awful far from the collegium for a mage.." 

I grinned. "How do you know I'm a mage?"

He looked at me like I was a poppy-addled child. ""

"Well and so," I agreed. "You are correct. I am a mage."

"So why are you here? I thought mages couldn't cross the border. At least, I've never seen it, and I've seen more mages than anybody else in this town."

If he'd been present at Caieta's coronation, I believed his claim. We were a far cry from the capital.

I smiled grimly. "I never much believed in avoiding things just because they're uncomfortable." That philosophy had cost me my marriage, but this man didn't need that much insight into my problems. 

==Mention the old gods somehow.==

==That night, once the boy is settled in, he stares out across the river.== 

The Tallan roads ran east, toward the collegium, but I looked outward, where the orchard lands of Mallorn met the Sea of Songs. Tal had nothing for me now. 

A rainbow of power popped and curled along the coast, where the driving conquests of the ancient empire stopped cold not by the icy sea, but by the power of the island Queen. 

No magic could pass the border. It spun, churning. Beautiful and deadly, everything -- and everyone -- I've ever loved. 

==Mention his divorce.==

=/=

==As though summoned by the thought, ex-wife arrives; he shouldn't be surprised, though he was. Tal has fallen, she cannot still be in Tal, for she is its ruler. But he never expected her to run to him. He'd gone into exile to avoid her, after all. Make sure to mention her strength. The circumstance of her finding him. Where are her guards. Etc.== 

"Haven't I been a good leader?" she sounded bewildered and I felt a stir of pity. A decade of collegium training had been devoted to teaching her the importance of her role. She had fought a bitter, secret war to become mantelaine of Tal, prevailing over classmates far more ruthless than she--not on the strength of her magic, but rather strength of purpose. Caieta had always done her best to be fair, to use her magic to help people. The collegium had taught her well, in that sense.

In others, she was staggeringly ignorant. 

"It's not about you, Mantelaine."

Her confusion spiked into something sharp and brittle. Not anger, but close. It had always been that way when I offered a contrary thought; just one of the reasons I had given up the capital in favor of the coast. "Then what is it about?"

"People remember the Republic. Good mage, bad mage; you're still a mage, and most aren't. They remember the glory days, when mages were too few to rule the world."

She rolled her eyes impatiently. "Mages have made it a better world. Their 'golden age' was poverty and war and--"

"And it was theirs. Poverty is relative. They aren't mages. Their children aren't mages. They are never going to have the opportunities we did for a better life."

"That's nonsense," she snapped. "Your own brother is the perfect example of--"

"My brother is dead," I said. "Evander is the *perfect* example of the truth every null knows; even the weakest mage has more chances than the smartest null."

"They're burning our cities for the *illusion* of power?"

"Can you think of a better reason to kill someone?"

"How can you be so calm!"

If she thought I was calm, it was but fresh proof that I'd had no business as her Consort.

"You're the strongest mage of your generation, Caieta. Why are you asking *me* for help?"

Anguish stained her features. "The cost of solving this on my own is too high."

My eyebrows leapt up. "Too high? What could possibl—oh." I gave a bitter laugh. 

"I could kill them all," she snapped, and she could. 

But she couldn't stop them, which meant she couldn't save them, and all the power in the realm couldn't make that fact bend to fairness. 

I kept my voice bland. "Why don't you?" She'd left me, after all, because I lacked the savagery required of a Consort. 

"That's not what magic is for!"

I stared at her. "Magic is power, Caieta. It doesn't have *purpose*."

Her lip curled. "All power has purpose."

It had the feel of all too many of our fights. "You didn't come all this way to debate philosophy. What do you want from me? Why aren't you "

"That's the slow road to making the rebellion worse, it's not a solution." She took a deep breath. "I need a third option."

"I couldn't save our marriage. You expect me to save all the nulls in Tal?"

"You have three days. I hope you'll try harder for their sake than you did for mine."

Fury spiked in my jaw, muscles so tense I heard the bone creak, but I said nothing. 

Nothing I could say had ever changed her mind before, once she decided something was my fault.

The women in my life had always been happiest with the products of my work; they never understood the process. 

==Need to include the apprentice here!== 





"They called us gods, once," I told Caieta. 

She frowned at me. "I never took you to be a deist."

"I never was," I said. "Still, the old gods are remembered in the borderlands."

"and?"

"You've heard the phrase, 'beyond the veil'?"

She rolled her eyes. "I had the same teachers as you. Read the same books. Of course I have."

"Behold, the veil."

"I am the mantelaine, I can sense--"

"I know you can always sense it," I snapped. "I want you to *notice* it."

She closed her eyes, and looked. 

Her voice went low. "Is it always like this?"

"No."

"Why is it so--"

"Violent? Because you're here. Your magic is strong, but so is the Ice Queen's. The other mantellaines are powerful, too. You've all claimed the land. The early mantellaines, their power reaches as far as they could sense. "

"That's still true."

I shook my head. "No. Now you can sense as far as your power reaches."

"What's the difference?"

I bit my tongue at the reminder that aetheric resonance had no correlation to intuition, or even intelligence. "Can you sense that tree over there?" I pointed at the lone oak in the clearing. In autumn, the locals collected its acorn for flour and baked harvest bread. I'd been here long enough to prefer the texture of its taste to the wheat bread served in the city.

I gathered my power, every speck I could spare, and shaped it into a spear. It wasn't very elegant; I had never been a skilled spellcaster, lacked the delicate touch needed for magic more intricate than manifestations. 

I had gotten very good at controlling the more primitive magics, though. Here on the border, there had been little need for subtlety, which was one of the benefits of my self-imposed exile. 

I hurled the spear into the veil. 

==description open to see inside. virgin lands== 

"That's your plan?"

"They don't want us here? Let's leave."

She laughed bitterly. "Typical. What's the catch?"

"And if the mantellaines leave, the veil will fall. Without the veil to disrupt the border between realms, there's no way to cross."

"You can save everyone except me."

He shrugged. "Or, you can send the rebellious nulls through. At least that way you aren't killing them."

"Me?"

"Someone has to hold the tunnel open," I said, releasing my magic. "Someone stronger than me. That little pinprick is about all I can manage."

She studied my aura, drained and empty, for a long moment, then turned back to regard the veil.
