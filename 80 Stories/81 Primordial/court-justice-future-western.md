Adalia had to raise her voice to be heard over the steady growl of the magicycle she rode south, so she didn’t do it often. But when she and her two travelling companions crested the last hill for the day, she made an exception and said, “Almost there.” 

“Yep,” answered Daniel from her left. 

“I hope the docket hasn’t gotten any busier.” This from her left. 

“Me too, Roddy. I know I’m not supposed to play favorites, but the sooner we’re on our way out of Hawksmoor, the happier I’ll be.” 

In the approaching distance, clouds of black smoke emerge from the tall towers of the city. Heather grows along the stone roadway their magicycles float over, though the pink and purple flowers become patchy the farther down the hill they go. 

Before long, they arrived at the gates. The guard assessed the trio before asking for their names and their business in the city. Adalia stared at him for a minute before she managed to force a smile. “Justice Adalia Wynn, and bailiffs,” she said. “We’re here to hold court.” 

“Of course, Justice. I should have recognized their uniforms. To be fair, I’ve never seen you without your robes.” 

“I don’t like to get them dusty.” 

“Ah, that makes sense,” said the guard.
