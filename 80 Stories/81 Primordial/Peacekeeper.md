## The Story

Georgette reached out with her implant to request an extraction and encountered only blank white nothingness. Since she was currently knee deep in swamp mud, fleeing pursuit by a series of $peace officers who function as secret service$ who had just lost their president, this presented a problem. 

GeneEs had the best immune systems on the planet and it was hot enough in this hellscape that she wasn't worried about hypothermia—but if she couldn't call for an extraction, an abandoned swamp in the middle of the interdicted zone was the worst place she could be stranded. 

Technically her presence in the Amazon Preserve was illegal. A massive violation of the treaty that had established the preserves as sovereign—and given control of everything outside the Preserves to the technocracy. 

Technically, she had just murdered a popular indigenous leader in cold blood. 

She'd trained to fight with guns, with knives, and with her teeth if need be, but against humans and their domesticated weapons. She was confident in her ability to kill a dog or even a falcon with her bare hands, but snakes were another matter entirely. 

They'd bred the atavistic fear of slithering monsters out of her — the technocracy's genetic engineering was an incredibly targeted things. That didn't mean that the $copperheads$ sliding around in the muck wouldn't bite her, though, and there was fuckall her breeding could do about a tablespoon of snake venom coursing though her veins. 

_Focus,_ she told herself. She wasn't in any more danger from snakes than she'd been four minutes ago. It was only sort of a lie, but Peacekeepers were good at lying to themselves. It was part of the job description. 

"Probably just satellite blip," she said out loud, but it wasn't convincing. The technocracy had achieved perfect control over Earth's orbit over a century ago. Every satellite in space was carefully controlled and backed up with more redundancies than Georgette could honestly comprehend. 

She was an assassin, not an academic. 

A bright red frog croaked six feet from her head and she nearly stabbed it. 

She tried again to contact her handler, who was to all intents and purposes telepathic, but again, nothing.

The swamp went silent around her, the sounds of cranky wildlife replaced with the distinctive whirr of an airboat. 

How had they found her so fast? She'd shot President $Maya name$ from nearly six thousand yards away, with a _disruptor,_ not a gun. It should have taken another three days for him to drop dead of an aneurysm, the blood vessels she'd damaged finally bursting long after her extraction. Instead, he'd died instantly, his head exploding in a gory mess that would eventually puzzle at least one coroner, but had confused the domestic security forces not at all.

They'd run right for her, and since the Preserves were by definition the opposite of an densely populated urban environment, it had been all but impossible for her to disappear into the crowd. 

Fine, she'd trained for this. Not in years — blowing your cover after a catastrophic technical failure and losing contact with your handler was the kind of trifecta of suck usually reserved for graduation exams — but she was a professional. 

Georgette slid beneath the soup-brown water, hiding herself in a muddy patch of of $lilies$ and peered at the boat as it approached. 

She could have hidden herself completely, to ensure she couldn't be tracked by $radar but heat-sensing$, and if she could count on extraction, she would have. Mission bungled but accomplished, time to go. 

Instead, this had turned into a recon mission. 

The Preservists didn't use implants. As part of their separation treaty with the technocracy, they'd wrangled the right to 'personal autonomy,' which meant they bred fast, repudiated progress, and died young. She'd never known one to enhance a limb, much less input receivers so the technocracy's tame telepaths could offer direct help whenever needed. They mostly stuck to antiquated tech like computers, which they wore on their wrists and noses, like primitives. 

She needed one of those computers. 

The boat slowed down. She couldn't hear their words, but she saw the helmsmen's shrug. 

Had they tracked her? She didn't see how it was possible — but she didn't understand why her handler had gone white and quiet, either. 

- [?] how did she get here? A boat of her own? Did she swim? Are there trackers on all the preserves boats? Did she canoe? That would be slow, right? Her own airboat? I don't know.
- [!] need to add in more setting details to make it really _feel_ like the Amazon. The humidity. The vines. The density of the jungle. The wildlife. 





%% %% 
- [i] I think this might be a novel that starts off in the moment that [[Jia's Cove]] (GeneE: Exodus) triggers? Maybe [[(FF) Recycled]] is the same time? It should probably come first. I like the idea of all these different stories being all incited by the same "event." 
- [i] suggest an "idea" instead of an "info" admonition that shows up as a lightbulb emoji, for Sanctum. 




%% 

Peacekeeper. 
Why is she in the swamp? — To get an extraction.
Why is she in the preserve? — Recon. There's a rumor that the person behind the hack in Recycled was hiding there. She's trying to figure out if it was an individual or an organization responsible.
