There were advantages to taking Blaze with him on the trip north, other than the obvious training that Baxter would be able to impart to his son. Since Blaze wore the Red, they would be able to shave off quite a bit of time. The Winds, those psychic roadways that allowed the Blood to travel the Realm, were much denser—and faster—the darker the Wind. There were coaches, of course, that were available to transport the Blood. His family even manufactured some for export to other Territories. But no one who wore a dark Jewel was foolish enough to waste their potential by driving one—not as a job at least.

Transporting family on special occasions was acceptable.

They weren’t taking a coach today, though, not even one with Blaze at the metaphorical reins. Blaze just slipped a Red shield around his father and together they rode it north toward the Dhemlan border. Since they rode the Red, they were able to land much closer to their destination than Baxter would have otherwise been able to manage.

Instead of heading straight to the factorage, however, Baxter led his son and heir to a small café on the same street. It was close enough to the border to serve tea.

“Never pass up an opportunity to have a drink here, son,” Baxter said jovially as they took a seat by the window. “You can’t get spiced tea like this anywhere else in the Territory—and believe me, I’ve tried. I even tried to buy the recipe from the proprietress, but she refuses to sell.”

Before Blaze could reply, sharp, amused laughter rang out from behind the counter. “Ha! If you could get it at home you wouldn’t come here,” said the witch, “and if you got your grubby little hands on it, you’d set up competing shops and then how would I feed my brats?”

Baxter put his hands over his heart. “I would never.”

She sniffed. “Well, maybe you wouldn’t at that. But you’d for sure stop making excuses to come north.”

He grinned. “Would you miss me?”

“Your marks,” she retorted, but even a stranger could tell she didn’t mean it. She caught the boy’s eye and winked. “Your father lent me the marks to start this place,” she explained.

“Even that didn’t charm her into sharing the recipe,” he said mournfully.

While they talked, she fixed two big, steaming cups of fresh brewed tea and set them on the table without asking what either wanted. It was then that she caught the Green Jeweled ring on Blaze’s hand. She paled a little, so little it was hardly noticeable, before she recovered her aplomb. “And you must be Blaze,” she said. “I thought you’d be younger, Lord.”

“Sorry to disappoint, Lady,” he said in a reserved tone that was too self-confident to really be called shy, but could definitely be considered distant.

She offered a hesitant, nervous smile before slipping back to the counter.

*Put up a psychic shield,* Baxter told his son on a spear-to-spear thread.

*Not aural?* the boy asked, surprise suffusing the psychic communication.

*I won’t insult her like that,* Baxter explained, his tone heavily implying that such a thing should have been obvious. Then, he softened the chastisement. *Besides, I still want to be able to communicate with the other people here, if need be—and hear what’s going on around me.*

It was clear that Blaze didn’t completely understand, but his darker Jewels didn’t make him willing to tangle with his father—at least, not over this. He put up a Red psychic shield, protecting their psychic scents and preventing anyone from getting a sense of their emotions—or the psychic threads being sent back and forth between father and son.

*Do you understand what’s about to happen?* Baxter asked his son.

*I think so, sir.*

Unlike himself when he was younger, Blaze didn’t seem to chafe under the firm grip his forebears kept on the family business. Either he was less impatient than seemed possible for a twenty one year old male, or he was very good at hiding it. Baxter wasn’t sure which he would prefer.

*Repeat it back to me,* Baxter ordered because, as much as he hated to admit it, his father’s teaching style worked. And now that he thought about it, Blaze was about the age he’d been when Bertram introduced him to Arielle. Perhaps he should start seeking a suitable woman for his son, but that was a matter for another time. It was best they both focus on the matter at hand.

*Yes sir. Grandfather is concerned that some of the accounts coming out of the factorage aren’t what they should be. You and he suspect either embezzlement or a cover up to hide losses that shouldn’t be happening. There is little direct proof, which is why we are here and wearing our Birthright Jewels instead of letting me wear the Red. We don’t want to spook them.*

*We don’t need the Red to handle this problem,* Baxter told his son. Not that he was sensitive about the fact that his father and his son both wore the Red and he the Rose. It wasn't like he worried about his father skipping over him in the succession. Not at all. *And if there is anyone who hasn’t heard that you made your Offering, I see no reason to educate them as to your mature strength. If you chose the proper moment to reveal it, the Red will be an even more powerful tool than it already is.*

*Yes, Father.*

Baxter nodded. “Now, tell me what you think of the tea.”

Blaze grinned like the boy he wasn’t long from being. “It’s excellent, Father. As you know.”

“Sometimes I wonder if funding this place wasn’t the investment I ever made,” he said.

“You should get a cup for Mother when we’re ready to leave,” Blaze suggested. “Riding the Winds with me, a warming spell should keep it hot long enough to get home.”

“An excellent idea, son,” Baxter said, beaming.
