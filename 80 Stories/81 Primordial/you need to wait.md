%% spun off from [[The Dead King's Daughter]], needs a new character and to become its own thing with its own arc. This is meant to be a culminating moment in which the protagonist needs to SIT STILL AND WAIT which she is normally too impetuous to do.

It wasn't really a cave, at least not by Verity's standards. 

It was more like a pile of rocks that had happened to land just awkwardly enough to create a space protected from the worst of the wind and snow. "Is it safe?" she asked doubtfully. 

Where rocks fell once, they might again. 

Dirlan shrugged. "Nothing's ever really safe." 

She thought back to their broken mast of the _Doppleganger's Ditty_ and shivered. Looked at one way, Dirlan was right; any country farmer could get kicked by a spooked horse and die of a shattered skull. But looked at through any sane lens, some things were certainly more dangerous than others — and in that moment she'd much rather have been firmly ensconced on a farmer's bench, spooning radish soup into her tired mouth.  

"I guess there's not much choice." 

Dirlan grinned. "No pink lace inns here, I'm afraid." 

"It's not the decor I'm concerned with," Verity said with a fair approximation of her childhood nanny's prim tone. "It's the company."

Dirlan sobered immediately. "I'm sorry, Verity. But you can't make this climb on that foot, and there's not enough brush for me to make a sled, even if I could pull you. Most of the gear I'd intended to make this trip with is back in Dawgulf." 

He looked so ashamed she couldn't bear it. "It's not your fault the weather didn't cooperate," Verity said. 

"Promise me you'll wait for me." 

Verity quirked a bitter smile. "Where would I go?" she asked rhetorically, but she knew exactly what she'd do: she'd head back to Lnigh, find a healer, and find a way to get to Elford, where at least enough of the sailors spoke a language she knew that she might be able to find work as a scrivener or, better yet, an archivist. 

"I can see your brain turning it over," Dirlan said. "Please. I'll be back. But there are a lot of leagues of snow and ice between here and anywhere you can get help, remember? Especially on that ankle. If you get lost up here, or caught in an avalanche, or fall into a ravine, I won't be able to find you." 

"How will you be able to find me here?" 

He looked embarrassed. "This is, ah. I know it doesn't seem like much, but this is kind of a waystation. Everybody knows where it is." His expression faded into something much more earnest. "I mean it, Verity. Even if I die in a snowdrift, waiting here is the safest, smartest thing you can do."

She explored, first. No matter what Dirlan said, she'd spent a long time living in stone buildings, and she couldn't quite trust that there weren't any snakes, or bugs, or — silly or not — bears. 

Eventually she convinced herself that the small space was safe.

"I'll need a fire," she said. 

Dirlan shook his head. "There's nothing up this high that'll burn," he said. "We burn tulpi dung, sometimes the humans head down and harvest pine, but we don't it's a long hard trek and we don't like to call attention to the settlement. Everybody is happier when the Edarebians forgets we exists. That's one reason I go all the way down to Dawgulf. Lnigh is actually closer to [[Kortien Mountain]], but..." He grimaced. "Let's say there's a bit of an ugly history, there, and leave it at that." %% [[2021.11.03 The Impossible Knife (SS)]] + [[disappointed he's home]] %%

She had no intention of leaving it at that, but as bad as her ankle hurt, she could wait for answers. 

"Fill up the jug I gave you with snow and keep it close to your body and it will melt." 

"Then _I'll_ be cold," Verity objected. She hated to sound like a whiny child, but she was too scared to slap a brave face over the fears." 

"Just keep eating," Dirlan said. "I left you most of what we brought. Mix it with the water once it's melted, it'll thicken it up. Keep eating, keep drinking, keep moving, and keep out of the wind. I promise. You'll be okay." 

"As long as I don't get eaten by a bear." 

He flashed her a grin. "Don't be silly. Bears eat berries, not people." With that, he disappeared back through the mouth of the cave.

There really was nothing to do but wait.

Verity gritted her teeth. No matter what Dirlan said, she couldn't just sit in a cave and twiddle her thumbs. 

Her clothes were torn and her ankle was swollen to the size of a grapefruit — would she ever taste grapefruit again? — but the fire needed tending, so she fed it small pieces of tinder, just enough to keep warm. 

Higher up the mountain she wouldn't have even been able to find that much to burn.
