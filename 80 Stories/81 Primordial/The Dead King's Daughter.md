## The Story

Verity clenched a stylus between her fingers and bit her lip as she considered the blank tablet in her lap. Gillomp %% [[nichtdonts]] %% wax was expensive, and at this time of year so was the fire she'd need to re-soften it, so she didn't dare dawdle — but she didn't know what to draw. As the exiled daughter of the last king to rule a [[Nahrian Basin|Nahrian city]], she didn't dare design anything truly impressive; her enemies would offer it up as evidence of duplicity, forever convinced that everything she touched was destined to be the weapon that spelled their downfall.  

- [ ] why does she care about the expense? Where does her budget come from? When do her supplies get replenished? 

- [ ] who are her enemies? Priests? Who rules nahria now? A coalition of temples? A council of high priests? The biladiyn united behind a single mage would come later. But #fic/storyStem could be them finally breeding their healer goddess heh. 

Never mind that, unlike her father, she wasn't a rogue thaumaturge or that, unlike her father, she hadn't ever studied at the Temple of [[The Engineer]]. She'd never so much as held a sword in her hand, and every one 

--

Goal: make the accounts she's studying say something other than "you're broke." She trained to be a whitesmith but no one would let her work for fear she'd make weapons and raise and army to conquer her birthright or some such nonsense. Honestly she had no interest in fighting a war -- exile mostly just meant she didn't have to fend off courtiers anymore -- but if they kept her locked in this room for much longer without anything to DO, she was going to go mad. 

A knock; blessed relief from her endless frustration, she thought -- but no. Another courtier. 

"Yes?" She asked when he stood in the door wringing his poor hat in his hands. It was green, of felted wool, and she envied him it's warmth. X was *cold* in wintertime, which was a season she hadn't really believed existed until she'd left Nahria. 


---

The plot should be people from the [[Eheu Isle]] colony need her. The "courtier" offers to smuggle her out. 

---

"It would be a hard life, and a cold one, but you'd be doing good." His eyes were so earnest she almost believed him. 

%% this is the inciting incident %%

"What's in it for me?" she asked. "Say I run away with you and go to your mountain, what then? I'm a whitesmith, I've never so much as held a sword in my hand. I'm not even an engineer." 

"Look, we're not trying to be selfish."

---

"So you just sail around the world looking for dispossessed heiresses?" she asked sarcastically. 

He looked unexpectedly abashed. "Ah, no. I'm not really supposed to be here at all. I was buying grain when I got word that you were here." 

Her eyebrows raised. "And you heard somebody's sob story about the princess in the tower and came to rescue her?" 

Oh, how he blushed! Scarlet slithered up the sides of his cheeks, bright as sunset. "I thought you might like a chance to do some good," he said stiffly. He stood and reached to secure his coat. The buttons flashed, shiny and bright in the thin beam of light piping in from her single window. 

"I'm sorry," Verity said. She hadn't meant to prick his pride. "My manners have atrophied in captivity, I'm afraid." 

"Think nothing of it," he said. 

---

The walls were brick, hand-shaped and mortared long enough ago that she could see where the cracks had been patched. A mouse would have struggled to escape. 

- [ ] move this farther up. 

"How do you propose to get me out of here?" 

For that matter, how had he gotten in? The guards were usually willing to come in and leer, normally the only person who ever came to visit was Jfirn, one of the few scholars at the nearby university whose judgment the local despot trusted. 

To his credit, Jfirn was brilliant and kind and would never contenance the hurting of a fly, much less the creation of a war machine — Verity liked the old man, and was grateful for the company, because normally the only people who came to visit were courtiers bent on convincing her to marry. 

Not that she was opposed to marriage, it was just that she didn't want to marry a scheming prince, no matter where his loyalties lay. Her father wasn't a monster, no matter what they thought, but she didn't dare try to prove that — they'd think she was covering up her own crimes. 

- [ ] really going to need to re-arrange this

%% what's the obstacle? %%

"They've got me under armed guard and the walls themselves are enchanted to sound an alert if I leave the tower." 

She was lucky to have access to the whole tower, really. She'd heard of others who were locked away in single rooms, their meals delivered by children too simple to suborn, their bodies shackled to the walls and their magic drained into enchantments twice a day by priests. It was a wonder the _biladiyn_ stood for it, but they'd had much of their power broken in the wars, and they'd probably settled for the mages remaining alive. 

Not that it was ever hard to convince the powers that be to use the power of their prisoners, instead of waste it. Even Verity's little sketches — of toy boats for wealthy children to race in the harbor, of cheap little fish traps for the marsh people to hunt with — were all carefully archived at the university, for royal students to 

Once Jfirn had confirmed they were harmless, of course. 

As though Verity could somehow create a weapon that one of her father's loyalists could decode a secret to and use to go a-conquering again. 

%% Is Verity the daughter of the conqueror? %% 

"Enchantments can be broken," said the foreigner with a twinkle in his eye.

"Not easily," Verity said bluntly. "And you never told me your name." 

"Dirlan." 

* * * 

It was not Verity's first time on a ship, of course, but it was her first time so far out to sea. 

- [ ] where was she being held? I feel like Ulmes would be particularly stupid. Tiquell is south of Maehlorn, which would make sense as a place to send the exiled daughter of the conqueror of all Maehlorn. 

"What I don't understand," Dirlan said, "Is why you're in exile at all. 

Verity shrugged. "Nobody felt safe with me on the island, but nobody was willing to trust that if they sent me to the mainland, I'd stay there."

Dirlan raised an eyebrow. "They thought you'd raise an army and sail back and reclaim your birthright?" 

Verity shrugged. "It wasn't an unreasonable fear," she admitted. "My father wasn't actually from Maehlorn. He was born in Srin." 

"It took centuries for Maehlorn to get unified, you know. It wasn't like my father seized power because Maehlorn was so well-governed. The whole island has been a mess of fighting factions long before he showed up." 

- [ ] the conqueror was originally from Srin. This storyline is happening pretty far along, given that I make reference to an abbot. The _abbots_ are particular to Srin. He's totally separate from the Cult of Valor stuff. He follows the Conquistador pattern with Cortes, Srin is like Spain mixed with the Vikings in this analogy. Need to do a little more research into the pressures that sent the Vikings raiding, since Srin is so far south... maybe Urran makes more sense? Since it's farther north? Wherever I referenced in the [[disappointed he's home]] story as being a good source of ivory. That makes Maehlorn basically England in this analogy, and I think that works. 

"Not everywhere needs to be one big monolith," Dirlan said neutrally. 

Verity shrugged again. "Look, to be honest, I don't really care. I have no particular love of Maehlorn. I grew up hanging out in the Temple of the Engineer, and when my dad died, they shoved me in this tower instead of taking me on as an initiate."

"Fair enough," Dirlan said, and fell silent. 

* * * 

The wind lashed the ship, whipping the mast from side to side even though the sails had already been removed. 

Verity braced herself against the railing and screamed, "Let us help!" 

"Nothing you can do!" the captain shouted back. "Get below!" 

She could barely hear him, but she understood. It was just one more opportunity for her to make herself useful by staying out of the way. Another day where her fate lay in someone else's hands.

She stumbled on her way down into the belly of the boat, which no matter what Dirlan thought did not deserve the appellation 'ship.' He caught her before she fell to her knees, which, on the one hand she was grateful and on the other, just made her want to scream all the more. 

"Thank you," she told Dirlan, then sighed. "I hate this." 

He squeezed her shoulders. "Storms pass." 

"Not the storm!" she said, exasperated. "The waiting. The doing nothing." 

"The feeling useless?" he asked sympathetically. 

She pursed her lips rather than answer. It felt petty to say aloud. 

"You're good at other things." 

She rolled her eyes.

"Hey, look, I get it. But you get used to it, or you go mad. I was born on top of one of the highest mountains in the world and most of my friends had wings. Does it look like I have wings? No. It sucked being the only kid who couldn't fly, but I'm good at other things. My friends back home can barely even _breathe_ on a ship like this, much less sail a ship. But they're the only ones who can herd [[tulpi]]. They herd, I trade, we're a community. Sometimes you have to let other people do the hard part." 

"I've been letting other people do the hard parts my whole life, Dirlan, while I draw and waited around to get sold off to whichever man of power some mage-priest I never met thought he could trust." 

She felt his hands convulse on her shoulder, and wasn't sure what it meant. Probably nothing — the ship bucked again, and they fell together, Dirlan guiding them into the linen hammock that hung from hooks on the walls. 

It wasn't graceful, but at least it didn't hurt. 

The wind rattled the hatch. 

"You've sailed before," Verity said. "Is this normal?" 

He shrugged. "[[Burcad|My father]] was a sailor. This is my first trip at sea, actually. Well, I guess my second, but it's the return trip. To hear my father tell it, pirates and storms and shipbreaker %% adult male [[snapper]] grpups %% pods are the norm and the very peaceful trip I had to visit the Voldshee Mountains was the exception." 

%% he was there to find an artifact Kala abandoned there for her wedding maybe? %%


Eventually, they fell asleep. 

* * * 

When the captain came to wake them in the morning, the circles under his eyes were the blackened purple of a schoonery rose. Verity winced, guilt clawing at her liver. 

"Topside's clear enough to be safe," he said, sounding exhausted. He didn't comment on their sleeping arrangements. Verity wondered if he even noticed. 

Verity rubbed grit from her eyes and pushed her way out of the hammock, base feet hitting the wooden floor with barely a whisper. 

Dirlan wasn't nearly as graceful. Even wrapped in the thin tulpi wool socks he hadn't taken off even to sleep in the tropics, his every step thudded as they climbed topside. 

"It's a wonder you haven't broken your neck wearing those things," Captain Skertin commented. 

"Tulpi wool is surprisingly grippy," Dirlan replied.

He might have elaborated further, but his head poked up through the hatch and he sucked in a breath. "Oh no." 

Skertin grunted. "Said it was safe. Didn't say it was good." 

Verity clambered up behind Dirlan, straining to see what had prompted Dirlan's despair. 

The whole deck was littered with splinters and sawdust. Buckets and barrels were scattered all around, and at least one railing was broken. Without sails, the whole ship looked naked as a plucked chicken. It took her a moment to realize what else was wrong. 

The mast was broken. Verity whistled through her teeth. Not just broken — gone. 

"What now?" she heard her voice before she realized she was speaking. 

The captain snorted and rubbed his face. "Now I take a nap." 

Verity opened her mouth to object, then closed it immediately. The man was dead on his feet, and as captain, he was the one person who needed to be well-rested. 

"We'll help the crew as best we can," Dirlan said. 

* * * 

"You didn't inherit any of your father's magic?" 

Verity shook her head. "No. If I had, I'm sure things would have been very different."

Dirlan looked rueful. "You'd be a queen, probably, and Maehlorn ruled by a stable dynasty again." 

Verity recoiled in surprise. "No, I'd probably be dead. Or maybe locked in a Biladiyn fortress somewhere, if the rumors are true."

Dirlan hadn't ever heard of the Biladiyn, of course. He'd been born half the world away, in a tiny village stop a mountain so high normal people had to wear enchanted masks to breathe.

%% 

%% While waiting for rescue from the broken mast (Dirlan POV): %%

"'Waiting patiently' is just another way to say 'giving up,'" Verity said flatly. He could tell she was angry. %% this is the central emotional conflict in the story. %% "If I had waited around for rescue in that tower, it never would have come. Or did you forget that you only came for me because I got good at making myself useful."

Damn him, but it was true. 




* * * 

They switched ships in Eggodh. "Skipple Bay is no place for a seafaring ship," the captain said apologetically when Dirlan objected. "Don't worry, 



"I'm sorry," he said to Verity. "Normally I charter out of Grinebo, but with the storm..." 

* * * 

%% 
Need a scenario where she has to sit and wait it out. For example:
- [ ] bedside vigil where "doing something" could kill Dirlan, i.e. "you don't move someone with a head injury..."
- [ ] chemistry it would be dangerous to fiddle with.
- [ ] "don't job his elbow" like if he's growing something with magic. 
- [!] Gets left in a cave in the mountains with an injury... has to wait for rescue. If she leaves, how will he find her? She has to trust. 
%%

[[you need to wait]]

%% Does this plotline really make sense? I mean she basically waited in that tower the whole time, right? yes she waited but productively. Maybe it would make more sense if she had to be brave enough to actually _go_ and do something? I'm not sure this whole Egri thing makes sense. 

Unless she was already planning her escape before. Or had tried to escape a bunch of times?  

Who is she in the beginning? A pampered princess who just draws, doesn't _act_. Maybe it makes more sense for her to have to overcome her nervousness and _act_. But I can still use this section for something else, if I break it out and refactor it into a _different_ story.%%

%% ok better idea for Verity. She needs to _act_ but she's _scared_ and Dirlan has to convince her. That's basically what happens in part one --- she's paralysed, Dirlan convinces her to _do_ something. But at the climax/end Dirlan isn't there to push her, she has to do it on her own. It's something she does under her _own_ impetuous. But what? %% 

Dirlan wasn't moving. Verity bit her lip to suppress the panic his motionless form evoked beneath her sternum and pulled off his backpack. 

Had to keep him warm. If he wasn't moving, he wouldn't be able to stay warm on his own. 

Could she pitch the tent? What if she did it wrong. Or worse, broke it, somehow. 

No choice. No time to sit around dithering. She had to try something. 

Breath puffing white in the icy air, she managed to pull Dirlan's unconscious body over towards the rocks. She was terrified to start another rockfall, but she remembered Dirlan's warnings about the wind, and there were no trees for miles. 

She pitched the little dome-shaped tent in the shadow of the rocks, and carefully dragged Dirlan's prone form inside. She couldn't keep the snow out, but hoped it wouldn't matter. It would melt, or it would freeze, or both, but the important thing was that Dirlan was out of the wind. 

- [ ] find that section from Dune where they do basically the same thing but in the snow, heh. 

The thick leather of the tent blocked out the light. Verity groped for the flap, but gave up on the idea of a fire. There was no telling what the smoke would do to Dirlan's concussion. 

Dirlan's whole body twitched as he woke. He grunted. "This wouldn't be a bad way to wake up if it weren't for the headache," he mumbled. "Are you okay?" 

"I'm fine," Verity said tartly. "Except for the years of my life you scared off, diving into the snow like that!" 

"Heh." He winced as he rolled over. "



%% Move this to the top when she's considering leaving with Dirlan in the first place. %% 

It would be a better life than she would ever have gotten back home in her tower, in the gilded cage she'd earned as a dynastic bargaining chip, albeit a harder one.

It wasn't the life she wanted. 

Damn it, she wanted to _help_ people. And maybe it was selfish of her, but not just a few people, not just a handful of people she could touch directly. Maybe if she hadn't been born the daughter of a dictator she could settle for a life where she had just a few positive influences on a few people, settle for teaching a few kids or being nice to a few broken sailors, but her father had decimated armies. He'd burned cities. Broken entire cultures. 

%% here's another nice underlying theme statement %% 

Maybe it was foolish to take up the burdens of her forebears, but she'd spent her whole life being bartered back and forth between factions on the strength of that legacy. She'd benefitted her _whole life_ from her father's life and if she'd suffered the loss of her freedom, then no less had she always had food on her plate and clothes across her belly. 

Verity had never been in danger, only captivity. She'd been bored, not _threatened._ 

It was nothing compared to the fate her father's victims had suffered. 

Perhaps if her mother had bothered with the raising of her, she might have come out with a different ethical code. But Nanny had been a no-nonsense woman who brooked no nonsense from her charges. She'd prized problem-solving, self-awareness, and the basic decency to clean up after one's own messes. 

A well-developed sense of responsibility was a harsh mistress, but at least Verity had always been able to look herself in the eye... 

...and, just as important, for all that she had enemies, no one hated _her._ Not like they'd hated her mother. 

Verity shuddered at the memory of her mother's death. Deriana had been beautiful before they drowned her beneath the Piers of Ponterro. %% traditional method of execution in Nahria. %% When the divers finally recovered her corpse, her hair was blackened with mud, skin plump with

%% END MOVE %% 


- [ ] add a section where they wind up staying in an _aggressively_ over the top frilly inn in Eggodh as some kind of comedic relief scene. Ostensibly this is probably a romance.
