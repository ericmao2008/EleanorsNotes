- [I] Premise: a man gets randomly selected to serve on the board of hiring for a new king. Goes through the whole resume and interview process -- riff off of some of the AAM stories to make it outrageous and engaging. Riff off of the town with the mayor type guy with no power normally and the government run by a civil servant that got taken over by QAnon crazy guy because not enough people vote in mayoral elections -- #research and find that reference!

the fire!horses get dispatched by the  chief mages to fetch rural mages back to HQ for a critical vote about which mundane they're going to pick to lead them, the protagonist wants no parts of it but the horse doesn't take any of his shit haha

it's meant as a commentary on civilian control of the military blah blah blah snarky fire horses!


(which is a pretty good summary of how most of my short stories go  infrastructure!politics blah blah MAGIC)

Riding a quicksilver %% [[2021.02.01 Quicksilver]] %% stallion was not Reginald's idea of a good time, but one did not ignore a summons from the [[the Collegium of Tal]], not if one intended to keep one's head attached to one's shoulders<!-- make this less of a cliche-->;  the Colligeum took a dim view of rogues, and after the [[Salted Wars]], Reginald didn't blame them for wanting to keep magic heavily regulated and under the control of a central authority. 

Still, quicksilver stallions [^flavia] were a bitch to ride, and he was not looking forward to the duty he'd been summoned for. <!--expand on this-->At least they didn't insist on mage-collars anymore. <!--disjointed, integrate this idea better or cut it--> 

[^flavia]: the [[signum]] invented by Arminia's sister Flavia in [[Collared Mage]]

Before the quicksilver horse even deposited him in front of the Tower, petitioners were already lobbying him for his vote. 

==dialog==

No one wanted another mage-king (least of all Reginald) and most mages wanted nothing to do with the minutiae of ruling anyone but themselves. Collegium politics were cutthroat enough without risking the whole country on their infighting. Commoners lacked a mage's ability to defend themselves, so this compromise had been reached. 

Five randomly chosen mages selected a new king<!-- really more like a central administrative authority, a la that news story about the town that got taken over by the QAnon mayor--> from a pool of applicants. 

Reginald had never expected to be a kingmaker. 

The **system** had been designed to <!-- what? --> It was the best system anyone had come up with, even if it was a pain in the arse. 

His **foot** hurt where the too-tight stirrps pinched, but only a summoner could adjust a quicksilver horse adn Reginald didn't dare try to rest control of the beast from the Collegium official who had magicked it into being. 



Still, Mages were too powerful to be kept out of the halls of power. 

<!-- worldbuilding & plot notes:
  
Man gets randomly selected to serve on the board of hiring for a new king. The whole resume and interview process. Very corporate. Riff off of that town with the mayor type guy with no power and the govt run by a civil servant that got taken over by the craziest dudes.

A new administrator was chosen every half decade, there are two administrators much like how the Roman consulate worked; they serve an overlapping terms. So their terms are for 10 years each. they get 5 years as junior and then 5 years of senior, the protagonist original should spend some time thinking or reflecting or even arguing about how during his time as a novice the process for choosing a new administrator was not nearly so fraught, he should have been away in the province is for quite some time before the summons so he's a little bit confused about what the big deal is. Somebody should fill him in on maybe how the previous administrator was assassinated which almost never happens, there should be some sort of political turmoil going on so that that's really exemplifies a flashpoint.  
  
The lottery was random just like always, but the two fighting factions in the city agreed to disqualify all of the resident mages and bring in random lottery people from at least a hundred miles outside of the city, as a compromise position after something like the news article happened where somebody managed to sneak in an incredibly partisan administrator by subverting the process illegally.  
  
if Reginald doesn't choose the right person, it could lead to civil war.  
  
There's no way this is going to work as flash fiction, but it might be a viable short story. -->

- [?] What is the twist and/or punchline? This should be a shameless wish fulfillment story / how to deal with annoying people in meetings lesson story riffing off my experiences with unions, HOAs, jury duty and other  general bureaucracy.
- [I] Base at least part of this on the annoying guy from my union meetings. 
- [I] One of the reasons this system evolved should be something along the lines of the elite ingroup grossness from the fencing board stuff. There should be a bit of an "America's Next Top Model" energy for interviewing the next potential king.
