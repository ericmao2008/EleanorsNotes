- [i] An alien species that counts prestige in the number of spouses you've buried. Or is that too on the nose? Ehh it's too similar to first wive's club, I think. 
- [i] should be in [[80 Stories/82 Indexes/Verraine]] because it doesn't really fit anywhere else, I think. Alien from the [[crystal magic]] realm, maybe? 

They didn't realize I was male. 

It was the only explanation I could think of for why a group of six $alien species$ were sitting around a carafe of [[moonfish]] bile discussing the weather and oh-so-casually inserting as many mentions of dead husbands as they could into the conversation. 

The one with a ring of green snakes wrapped around her prehensile tail %% #research  prehensile tails this is a common scifi schtick but maybe I can do it better? %% held a priceless porcelain teacup a handspan from her nose and paused for effect. "Would you believe he expected me to _dance_?"

"No!" the woman I was trying to serve nearly knocked the bowl of [[snapper]] pie right out of my hands with her dramatics. I kept my face impassive, because, like everyone who worked at Portal Paradise, I was a a trained diplomat in the service of the Star Council. %% post-modern period of [[80 Stories/82 Indexes/Verraine]] history, after portals, after demesnes, after the queens and councils and that whole form of government becomes the norm. %%

It had taken me sixteen years to work myself up to this position, learning everything there was to know about the cuisines of all $number$ realms that could be reached from the $bifrost bridge analogy I'm using for this world$. I left home at sixteen, 

- [!] find all my notes about the old Verraine stuff and import them into this vault. Do I still have them? 
- [i] I like the idea of the serving staff being extremely well-paid and a high-prestige position, that feels like a nice subversion. 

"I like this one," Green Snake said in a language I realized belatedly she didn't realize I knew. "I think he would 




"I want to eat a platter of roast wyvern on plumberry sauce," she said in awkward Maehlensh %% the language spoken by future!Maehlorn people in [[Maehlorn]] it linguistically evolved from Nahrian but blends in a lot of loanwords from [[Arais Delta]] and [[Voldshee]] Mountains %%. 

I responded in the same language, though I spoke her native Cystyaln far better than she spoke the local tongue. Still, tourists liked to show off their efforts, and I was in the business of keeping rich travelers happy, not correcting their pronunciation. "Of course, madame," I told her instead.

Wyvern haunch was a gamier cut of meat than anything we locals preferred, but some travelers preferred the more exotic cuts of meat, especially the dangerous predators like snapper and [[wyvern]]. We imported wyvern from across the Strait, so it wasn't even local, but it came from this realm at all, which I supposed she thought of as good enough. 



When I returned with their meals, the women were flushed with something that was certainly not alcohol; moonfish bile was the purist natural substance in the $how many$ realms. The ancients had used it to clean fouled wells and bathe newborns, but these days, we used magic.

Well, most of us. Some of the neo-Valorists embraced the "back to nature" ideology and eschewed magic entirely, but they were a ridiculous fringe these days, nothing like the real Cultists of yesteryear.  %% see also [[2021.10.27 Poison (MF)]] %%


I almost laughed when I realized the truth: they knew I was male. They knew I was a fully sentient, despite my lack of a tail and the presence of my wings. 

They just thought I didn't _matter._

Somehow, I'd forgotten how poorly restaurant staff were treated in Cystyaln, but in my defense it had been years since I'd traveled to the $leeward$ realm, and I'd spent most of my time in the universities, where most everyone was well-bred but far too young for mating games. 

Not like [[Pontero]], where most of the time it had felt like mating games were the whole point of the courses, which existed only to subtly enforce the caste system that had been technically outlawed a century ago. %% [[marriage in-round creates castes]] %%

I blocked her magic with my own and $did something flashy to defend myself$

- [!] I don't like this ending, because it's a little trite, "servers are people too!" and the whole "twist! the people in power are aliens and humans are the animals in the zoo" thing is really overdone, but I think there's probably a way I can refine this later.
