unique or rarely used fantasy races:
- bat winged, cat clawed elves w / blue blood created by biomages in the salted wars. they live in the mountains, and were created because those mountains are so high that normal humans can't live there because of the low oxygen levels. but the mountains have some sort of special compounds that can interact with mage blood in order to create permanent enchantments of the type that Alyssa used when creating the tower in Temple mage. 

unusual framing device?

Get [puff pastry and women's bane](https://www.scribophile.com/authors/eleanor-cully/works/puff-pastries-womens-bane) into workable format to use as a base. Have her claws be a marker of noble blood, part of the breeding true part. The wings don't breed true for everyone, and neither does the blood they have low birth rates because of the blood problems and they have a three class social system where the wingless are the lowest, and winged and clawed are the highest. it would be cool if they can't tell if the wings work until they basically get kicked out of the metaphorical nest, there is a cliff that the age that's used to climb and the number of times you can climb it before falling and having to use your wings is considered a major marker of adolescent status. This Cliff should be deeply relevant somehow to the plot or escape, for example if it is impossible to get to the top just by wings, you really do have to climb, but wings will save you from falling to your death because of something like a smokestack style tunnel. Perhaps the cliffside is in a cavern. 

Change "noble" to Priestess. Change earned your claws to come into your claws. Get rid of the prophecy and change it to a deformity semicolon she does not have wings and therefore cannot fly to the bottom of the pit and arise back from it. The claws will allow her to climb later, but are not enough to make her accepted by the elders. This conflict will ultimately lead to her leaving to found another colony.

A wagon was built to carry lots of weight. And Chariot by contrast is built for speed. It is built for war. Anyone could drive a wagon, they were pulled by a state placid beasts chosen for stamina and calm more than anything. Chariots by contrast were expensive. They were tools of the elite, weapons. The Pegasus is that pulls chariots were among the most of expensive possessions known by her people. Highly trained, match sets that worked perfectly together, a new exactly how to act in concert with some of the most highly trained, athletic, educated sanguine had no business driving a chariot. She also had no choice enter enter.

she was born into the priestess cast. She is supposed to be one of the people who creates the crystals that her people trade. the crystals aren't naturally occurring, they come from the blood of her people people who cannot become mages because the biome magicians who created her people we're specifically trying to set up a system where he could harvest the crystals of magic that let magic work forever for enchantments and Moss. He built these people for a remote location where no one else could access them. He was a realm locker who had figure out secrets to immortality. Which didn't stop him from being murdered nearly 300 years ago, and whatever his intent it hadn't managed to keep the people isolated. Where there are people, they will find a way to meet other people and trade and love and war.

Women weren't allowed to take the cliff test; not enough of them for breeding purposes, they're too precious to risk. So Guine needing to risk her life is considered horrifying. Murdering a woman is considered sacrilege of the highest order. The 2 men bound to her were bound at the end of her ageset path, when she was age 16 (sets are 8-18 and so on, everyone who was 2 -- there's a ceremony for surviving to 2) in the preceding decade. They were selected at the end of the trials ; it's considered a reward for bravery and though she gets a veto, ultimately it's up to the priests who is selected to serve. 

But this will make the scene where she goes to retrieve the chariot that much more powerful. Why does she need the chariot? To escape another murder attempt! Ultimately she kills the assassin. 

But who is trying to kill her and why? 

But continue it: two days later, another assassination attempt. This time she's starting to think it's not an accident.
