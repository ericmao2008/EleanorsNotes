#### Brookside 

big well in the central square, where a pair of women were trading empty buckets for full. Children carried the buckets to and fro as the fire bridade tossed water on the logs walls of the flaming buildings. Thatch fires were all but impossible to stop, but they were still trying to salvage the walls. "I need a prybar!" Irella shouted. "

The tallest of the women—still half a head shorter than Irella—barked a hysterical laugh. "Ain't got time to get you what you want, Priestess. Town's on fire, if you didn't notice?" 

"I noticed," Irella said. The heat from the flames had already chapped her lips. "Tell me where to find a hammer, and maybe we can salvage something from this."

"Be lucky if the whole town don't burn," said the other woman, her hair tied back into the tutulus bun of a matron. She didn't even take her attention from the buckets long enough to glance at Irella. 

"I can stop the fire," Irella said, almost pleading. 

The matron shrugged, then glanced up at her taller companion. "Can't make her carry a bucket, Jirea." 

Jirea sighed, then gestured at one of the children running buckets. "Take the priestess to the sawmill. Get her what she needs." 

The boy handed off his bucket to the girl next to him, then dashed off

#### Memorial
The palace held no answers. Everyone she spoke to insisted that Eramepi had, in fact, died of bloodspot fever, which made no sense. 

The fourth minister she’d cornered, trying to find out what had gone wrong, who had allowed the Sovereign of Lysaria to die so ignobly, had finally taken some measure of pity on her – or perhaps gotten annoyed enough with her – and asked her to build Eramepi ’s memorial tomb.

She threw her whole being into the work. For three days and three nights she drew sketches, made calculations, and pulled raw aether into the mortal world. 

*Biladiyn* stood guard, first Alem and later others. She ate mechanically whenever food was offered, slept only when her eyes blurred and hands shook, and if any of her superiors from the Temple of the Architect came to interrupt her work, she ignored them so thoroughly that she couldn’t recall their faces.

Finally, as the sun setting over the Lysar turned the muddy river red, she was done. The tomb itself lay nestled between them in the palace gardens, an isosceles trapezoid, translucent enough to see the crystalline channels shot through the divine stone. Water from the terrace aqueducts flowed through the channels, and when his bones were interred, they would be protected by the Lysar itself.

Nine stelae towered over the tomb, one for each of the Lysarian cities Eramepi had come to rule. Aetherock was a poor substance for intricate relief work, but she’d willed it into line, and each stela detailed the story of how each had come under his aegis, some by siege and others through bribery and once, through single combat with the champion of a noble house.

“Were you there for all of that?” Alem asked quietly as she sipped water from a ceramic cup someone had set beside her. She could taste the dust on its surface.

“Eramepi is the one who found me in Uskune, back when it was just a hole in the hills and a little trade fair.” she said, staring at the stele of Uskune. Her parents, like most of the Voldshee, rarely ventured down from the mountains. But they’d had timber to trade, and the hunting that year had been bad enough to warrant the risk of raiders.

Eramepi found her, orphaned, chained to a cart bound for the slavers of Arais, and freed her, and taken her home to the Temple in Marna. It had been the third city Eramepi had claimed, after Marna and Keldehss went to war and Eramepi won.

“I’m sorry,” Alem said. “If you want to attend the funerary rites, tonight is the last night. Valentia plans to inter him at tidecome.”

It was high summer. The tides would shift shortly after dawn, and the Lysar would rise, lifting Eramepi’s spirit to the heavens.  Irella rubbed her face, then nodded. “Thank you.”

he led her to the central courtyard, where Eramepi’s sister had arranged for a bier.

Traditionally, Nahrian bodies were defleshed on the third day; only the bones were sacred. Eramepi was the Sovereign of the League of Lysaria, and with nine cities came nine Temples for each of the six Nahrian gods, and clearly Valentia had found a thaumaturge to preserve Eramepi while he lay in state.

Though it was the third night of the funerary rites,

#### Temple

“Lead the way,” Irella said, then followed the Rimush  out to the street.

Each of the six gods of Nahria boasted a temple in Oruku, but the Temple of the Architect was, as it should be, the most elegant. More practically, it was the tallest. Constructed by magic out of glittering golden atherok, it stood six stories high, tall enough to require a massive base to support its bulk. The layers were stacked in increasingly small sections, forming a stairway for the gods' journeys to the heavens. 

Alem split off once they reached the gate, bowing once to her and once to the *biladiyn* who guarded the entrance. She had no need of his protection within the Architect’s embrace. 

Or rather, the protections she needed, he couldn’t offer. 

Heroic statues dwarfed her as she entered, a sensation that was, as always, at once comforting and intimidating. The lemon-ash scent of incense filled her nostrils, teasing her with a flash of memory arriving at the Temple in Marna at the age of eight. With the might of the temple—of the Architect himself—behind her, she had no longer feared famine, or slavery, or abandonment. The only thing she had to fear was the High Priest and his orders—and the judgment of her peers.

She said nothing as they passed a supplicant, though she overheard the prayer; the woman’s family home had been destroyed in a recent spate of flooding. Irella couldn’t help but wonder whether that repair would be her next assignment. It was the kind of waste of her talents Avestur often tasked with.

Guilt flooded her at the thought. Aiding the citizens of Oruku was good work, and precisely the sort of thing that the Architect demanded of His followers. In some ways, it was the entire purpose of their temple, the entire reason Eramepi’s Counselor had pointed her toward His service. Though Irella was one of the strongest thaumaturges in the Architect’s service, and capable of far more impressive work than simple home repairs that even an acolyte could make without magic, she would rather help a fishwife than further embellish the palace square.

If Avestur would allow her to do even that, after she’d defied him once. 

He fell silent as he preceded her up the spiral stairs at the center of the temple, conserving his breath for the sake of his pride.  

At the top, fresh air cut through the incense that clung to her skin and robes. The sun had just begun to set over the Lysar river, the grayish blue bordered by lush emerald greens that the even finest weavers and painters had no hope of replicating.

“He wanted to see you right away,” the acolyte prompted her. 

She wasn’t the first priest to pause at the top of the stairs to appreciate the magnificence offered by the divine. EN-Avestur wouldn’t notice if she was a minute later than physically possible, but she didn’t argue.

She pushed open the heavy doors and faced her High Priest.

“You summoned me, EN-Avestur?”

“Quite some time ago,” he said, eyes still on his correspondence. Though Irella rarely had occasion to visit these offices, even she recognized that there was more than the usual amount of paperwork on his desk. EN-Avestur was an organized man, neat and tidy down to the precise trim of his graying beard, and it was not his nature to allow piles to grow, unsorted and precarious. Yet she could not ignore the evidence of her eyes.

“My apologies,” Irella said, bending her knees like a supplicant. “I was attending the memorial in the palace.” 

Avestur looked up then, taking note of her white attire with a flicker of surprise. “Ah. I suppose that’s an excuse, then.” He paused, visibly re-ordering his thoughts, which confused her. She’d been at the palace for the last three days. Surely someone had told him? “Were there other thaumaturges there?”

Irella opened her mouth to answer, but in truth, she didn’t know. “I wasn’t in the courtyard long, but I saw nobles from the Treasury, and nin-Firyala.”

He snorted. “Of course she was there.” 

This was higher level politics than Irella had ever been exposed to before. She shifted uncomfortably; en-Avestur was normally too savvy to telegraph his personal allegiances, and she had the uncomfortable feeling that she was about to get thrown into waters that were beyond her ability to navigate.

“Sir?”

### Marna

Not in such a critical moment for the future of the League.

If Valentia couldn’t hold the cities together, the peace they had worked so hard to build – a peace that marauders and slavers did not dare disturb – would crumble. Eramepi’s legacy would crumble. The incessant, petty raids would pick up and another generation would be left starving or orphaned or both. 

Irella was going to Uskune.
