	- purpose:: explain to financial supporters of the [[Obsidian Roundup]] how I leverage feedly, markdownload, and blockrefs to have a new atomic notes workflow. I use this method if I have two or more atomic notes related to an article because it generally means an article had enough "meat" to be useful in the long term (so I'm not just archiving everything I read) and I might want it to turn up in search later on.
