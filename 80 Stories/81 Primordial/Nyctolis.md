Crouching down in the shadows of the alley, I hid my slight form beside a metal trash can. I was grateful for the cool autumn air that kept the scent of rot to a minimum, but I was mostly just happy for the opportunity to be outside at all.

Even if it meant, as it always did, that someone was slated to die. 

I took another slow, silent breath of night air and and waited for my quarry to slip into the alleyway. Like me, he was a creature of the night, and like me, he preferred the alleys to the main thoroughfares. I knew because I'd seen it – seen him stalk the night for his victims, follow them back to their homes and drain them of their life.

There was something that I didn't share with my darkling cousin, though. 

I preferred ambushes. 

His footfalls were nearly silent as he stepped into the alley, but 'nearly' wasn't good enough to hide him from my half-human ears. He came a few steps closer to my hiding spot, and I started to rise from my crouch. Heedless of the noise, I pushed off and projected myself at the vampire as fast as I could. 

I took advantage of his surprise as I slid an iron-bound bit of sharpened wood from the sheath on my leg, but even still, he was quick enough to avoid the killing blow I aimed.

I felt the stake bounce off one of his ribs, missing his heart. He'd moved just a hair's breadth farther than I'd anticipated, and I paid for my miscalculation as his fingers wrapped around my throat.

I'll never know why he didn't crush my windpipe then and there – maybe he tried and the witches' spells did their job. I just know that his failure was a mistake that cost him the rest of his existence. 

I never miss twice. 

The fingers around my throat disintegrated as the chemical reaction spread through my victim's body. Flakes of ask fluttered down to dot my clothes, but despite my disgust I forced my expression into stoic lines. Though I could sense that the alley was bereft of all but the most negligible signs of life, I knew better than to assume no one was watching. 

In Meraburg, someone always was. 

Sometimes, I even got to find out who.

He walked into the alley with an expression so dark I couldn't help but fall back a step. Fine ash floated up into my nose, reminding me that I had nothing to fear from an angry face. Still, I couldn't see the point of involving myself in a confrontation that I hadn't initiated, so I slid to the side and tried to make myself inconspicuous.

I never had been that lucky.

His smoky gray eyes pierced mine and I froze without conscious thought. “Just what the hell did you do that for?” he demanded, continuing his forward march.

I felt like a child caught with his cat in the spin cycle. There was no point in denying it. I had a stake in my hand and a pile of ash at my feet. “My mother asked me to,” I said, stretching the truth but not by far. 

It had sounded a whole lot more like an order at the time. 

His eyes narrowed, but he stopped coming at me like some kind of avenging angel. He sniffed the air. I shifted from one foot to the other, adrenaline fading and good sense kicking in. 

Good senses, at least. He certainly wasn't human. 

“Dhamphir.” He said it like a curse. 

My body collapsed into a whirlwind of leaves before I had a chance to even think about what he might have meant.

I have no way of knowing how long it took them to reform my body, but when I came to again, I was facing the high priestess of my mother's coven. A few years ago, I had tried my hand at the study of magic, trying to figure out how it was that the witches controlled by body and sent me flying hither and yon on a whim. Unfortunately, I have not my mother's talent with the craft, and I remain clueless as to how it is they do what they do.

Regardless, though, there I was, trying not to shift from foot to foot as the priestess fixed me with her ancient, eagle-eyed gaze, when my mother's voice spoke to me from behind. “Despite your procrastinations, you managed your task, Cora. Thank you.” There wasn't a single watt of warmth in her voice, not that I expected there to be – I'd been in my teens before I discovered that mothers were supposed to love their daughters.

I'd been in my teens the first time I was allowed to step foot outside of the compound.
 
“Thank you, mother,” I said without shifting my stance at all. Usually I was welcomed back with a “well done,” so I wondered what I'd done wrong this time. I bet it had to do with the inhuman man who'd confronted me at the end, confirming if I'd needed it that the coven did, in fact, spy on me when I was out of the compound. On the other hand, I failed to see anything bad about how I'd handled the situation.

Undoubtedly, the high priestess – I'd known her since childhood and had no clue as to her name – would enlighten me. I could see her lips tightening as I failed to be intimidated by her stare, and stifled a smile in response. My life was measured in small victories.

Finally she deigned to speak. “You left a witness.”

I wondered if she were trying to bait me by stating the obvious. I could have objected – I was sure I hadn't been observed actually killing my target. I could have even shifted the blame – after all, they were the ones who'd failed to pull me out on time. I couldn't see the point of bothering, though. Arguing with the high priestess was futile and there was little point in presenting a defense.

They'd do with me what they would. I'd stopped trying to fight it long ago.

“What's worse, you talked to him and admitted your guilt.”

If he'd been a cop I'd eat my stake, but I knew better than to get drawn into a protestation.

“As such, it isn't safe for you to leave the compound for any more tasks for awhile.”

I opened my mouth before my better judgment kicked in, but I managed to click my teeth against the imprecations that sprung to mind. My teeth ground together, but I held my tongue. There isn't anything you can do, I told myself. I said it over and over, let the knowledge fill my mind with its simple certainty, using the syllables like a mantra.

I was surrounded by twelve witches in their place of power, any one of whom could slap a binding on me  before I managed to move more than a muscle or so. There wasn't any point in fighting the decision, and pleading with them had never worked before.

My shoulders were rigid, but I managed not to bring further punishment down on my head with my sharp tongue.

“Report to your quarters,” she ordered, and I jerked my head into a nod before striding past her toward the iron-bound door.

My steps didn't make a sound, no matter how much I wanted to stamp my feet on the ancient hardwood floor.

* * * 

I slammed the door to my bedroom, but didn't take comfort in the sound. It had a note of finality to it, made me feel trapped instead of venting my anger. I thought about throwing a glass against the wall, but had the presence of mind to know that I'd be the one cleaning it up. It wasn't worth it.

A dagger caught my eye. It was sitting on a table, but I snatched it up and threw it at the wall.

Include something similar?
Consider.

Idea for politics:
instead of general election
more like a jury – random pool picks based on their arguments & presentations.
^^ cool ^^
meraburg or nyctolis?

A crown of crows fly
miles above her head
missed by all but the
	most astute
and so she walks
among us
like she's one of us
signs of  royalty hidden
beyond the ken of eyes
restricted by mortality
	yet noted
by the wise
who let not their body
restrict the heights to which
their minds can soar
and so use science
	to see
that which man may not
have been meant to perceive
for who are gods to say
what restrictions there should be?
