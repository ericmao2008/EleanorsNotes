- [i] This is a good idea for a flash fiction piece. Toby has to repair a broken seawall to keep a trader's house from falling into the river, which matters because if he doesn't... what are the stakes? The trader will be mad okay sure but bleh, what could really happen? He's got mostly brothers, right? So what if the trader is the one he owes allegiance to, feudal clan house style, and if the house falls into the river they'll lose their status, and the clan is barely hanging on anyway. Why? What happened to the clan? Did somebody die to soon? Did they lose a trade war? Ever since the wife ran off with the biladiyn? Lol. It's good to involve magic in some small way, and the Arais delta people are supposed to be sort of modeled on divination and enchantments right? 

Toby shucked off his clothes and took a deep breath. He'd been preparing to dive into the marsh, but choked instead, gagged by the intense smell of excrement and rot. 

- [!] how do I indicate genre? edit this to punch up the threat level — doesn't inhale excrement, sees a marsh monster. but he has to fix it anyway. And Dahn has to keep the monster off, but Toby doesn't know if Dahn will manage it. #fic/editPending 

Dahn, the younger boy serving as his spotter, snickered. 

"Shut it," Toby snapped. "Or we're switching and you're going down there to fix the bindings." 

"Pap told you to do it," Dahn said.

Toby tightened his lips grimly. "Pap told me to see it done. Doubt he much cares if I toss you in and tell you how." 

"Sorry," Dahn said, more resentment then repentance in his tone. 

He wiped his nose and tried again, then slipped feet-first into the tea-brown water. 

Only a fool dove into the Arais Delta. It wasn't so much that the river was shallow, although with all the trees and mud and liles choking the waterways, he'd once thought that to be the reason for the rule. 

No, splashes had a way of attracting the [[Predator At Sea]] who haunted the swamp, hunting for prey big enough to be worth the effort. 

This close to Ulmes, there weren't many, but it was only a season ago that Toby had been tucked into the back of his father's canoe, hunting for predator — and it was a miracle he hadn't lost a leg. 

It didn't matter how many predators the delta boys killed, they always came back, hunting human. 

Don't think about that now. Focus on the seawall. Built from thick cypress logs nestled between tall pilings driven deep into the marsh bottom, the seawall was all that kept Ulmes from sinking into the marsh. 

Every spring the girls dredged the canals, hauling up bottom mud to raise and fertilize their gardens while the boys hunted the moonfish and predators kicked up by the ruckus. 

And every fall, the boys inspected the walls to make sure the whole city wouldn't break. 

Toby pulled himself down to the marsh bottom, fingers crooked and scrabbling for purchase on the algae-covered logs as he kept himself from floating.

His tendency to float was one of the reasons he hated chinampa repair duty — it was twice as hard for him to get down to the bottom, because he had to fight his own body instead of just sinking like his peers. But at least he wasn't ever afraid of drowning. 



He grabbed onto the log wall and launched himself to the surface, lungs burning. "I found it," he said once he'd caught his breath. "It's not a 

"Well what is it?" Dahn demanded. 

Toby wiped muck from his forehead with an equally-dirty hand. "Looks like a turtle tried to make a nest down in the crevice." 

"You're kidding. Underwater? What kind of turtle?"

Toby shrugged. "There's an air pocket. I don't think she's still there."

Marsh turtles were not known for their broodiness. 

"Well, are you going to bring up the eggs?"

Toby bobbed in the water, barely needing to kick his feet to keep his chin up. "Nah,
