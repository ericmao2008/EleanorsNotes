A priestess of the bureaucrat in nahria tries to reform. They drive her out. She tries to found the temple of justice. They attack her. But less CIA and more infighting. Get inspired by a biopic or story of a real dude maybe? The driving emotional component should be fury about things like the Rittenhouse verdict and connect to [[Chariot Racing Story]] analysis element and EULAS.
