THE BELLWEATHER BLIGHT
ACT ONE
PREMISE
As her people are driven to the heart of her territory by a fast-spreading blight that not only withers crops but infects all living things, Verraine’s newest Princess must master her wyvernborn gifts and win the trust of a populace more concerned with starvation than a ruler’s pride or upstanding idealism, a task made all but impossible by the truth behind the origin of the blight. 
OPENING IMAGE
MOOD & TONE 
The aggressive scents of lemon and pine warred with the heavy steps of the upstairs neighbors as Guine hurried to banish the oppressive chill with inadequate firewood and magic she wasn't supposed to know. 
LOCATION 
This will be set very early in the timeline of the world itself, on a fantasy world, in a sort of fluidly pre-feudal time as the feudal system truly kicks off and the first Queen is crowned, creating the region of Mallorn. 
THEME 
Overcoming adversity (Societal issues): How to surmount obstacles in life - physical, mental or emotional.
The hero must face a fear and overcome a dark presence (literal or metaphoric) that exerts a destructive force over a place or a group of people. The story requires the hero to display courage and fortitude, and to think quickly and outwit the evil. The reader is firmly on the side of the protagonist as he digs deep to be the best version of himself.
