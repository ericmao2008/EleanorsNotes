"We arranged it while you were sparring with the boatswain's daughter," Alem explained. 

Enduca flashed a grin then turned toward Rimsuh. “Do the chefs here still make those sour fish rolls? The grilled ones?” Enduca had turned out to be as enthusiastic about food as she was sparring with the slender sword she wore across her spine.

as Enduca disappeared into the streets of Marna, her short black braids bouncing.

She would have preferred to walk, but speed was of the essence—the Monche caravan was due in Uskune three days hence, and en-Avestur had given her a long list of preparations to make. 

Almost, she didn’t care. Eramepi was gone, Valentia treated her little better than a half-trained pet, and the senior High Priest of her Temple cared more about appearances than his sacred duty. The *biladiyn* wouldn’t stop her from boarding a southbound coach and riding to the sea. She could book passage on a ship and travel the continent, digging wells and building bridges like an itinerant saint. She could hike toward the mountains of her birth, and—

She hardened her jaw. If her clan had wanted her, they would have come for her years ago. She wasn’t going to crawl back now. Not after she'd worked so hard to find a place for herself in Lysaria, no matter how precarious that place looked at the moment. 

She had done good here in the lowlands. She was going to *keep* doing good, or what else had been the point of her life?

"Who's that at the dock?" Enduca asked as they disembarked. 

"Looks like our third," Alem said with satisfaction, waving to the man in *biladiyn* grays waiting at the end of the dock. 

"Orders came through the Archivist's Temple," he said when they got closer. The shadow of a moustache twitched over his aquiline nose as he spoke. "I'm Rimush, assigned to nin-Irella, bound for Uskune?" 

Irella nodded as the other two introduced themselves and fell into a protective triangle around her. "Our new Sovereign wants Temples there built as soon as possible, so I intend to move quickly." Her worries about lingering too long in Marna weren't something she wanted to speak about openly. "Is that alright?" 

If he wasn't already ready to leave, she didn't intend to wait for him, but he nodded and she relaxed. 

“You don’t want to wait for the cargo?” Enduca sounded surprised.

Irella shook her head and started walking, trusting him to follow. “It will take the teamsters days to unload and haul all the brick and ceramics en-Avestur wants in Uskune. We don’t have that kind of time.”

, then took his leave for the night. In the vestibule, she was alone with her thoughts for the first time in days. She paused in the privacy for one brief moment, burying her hands in her hair and tugging on the roots, her thoughts chasing each other like furious squirrels. 

Or rather, the protections she needed, he couldn’t offer.

“He wanted to see you right away,” the acolyte prompted her. 

She wasn’t the first priest to pause at the top of the stairs to appreciate the magnificence offered by the divine. EN-Avestur wouldn’t notice if she was a minute later than physically possible, but she didn’t argue.

She pushed open the heavy doors and faced her High Priest.

“You summoned me, EN-Avestur?”

“Quite some time ago,” he said, eyes still on his correspondence. Though Irella rarely had occasion to visit these offices, even she recognized that there was more than the usual amount of paperwork on his desk. EN-Avestur was an organized man, neat and tidy down to the precise trim of his graying beard, and it was not his nature to allow piles to grow, unsorted and precarious. Yet she could not ignore the evidence of her eyes.

“My apologies,” Irella said, bending her knees like a supplicant. “I was attending the memorial in the palace.” 

Avestur looked up then, taking note of her white attire with a flicker of surprise. “Ah. I suppose that’s an excuse, then.” He paused, visibly re-ordering his thoughts, which confused her. She’d been at the palace for the last three days. Surely someone had told him? “Were there other thaumaturges there?”

Irella opened her mouth to answer, but in truth, she didn’t know. “I wasn’t in the courtyard long, but I saw nobles from the Treasury, and nin-Firyala.”

He snorted. “Of course she was there.” 

This was higher level politics than Irella had ever been exposed to before. She shifted uncomfortably; en-Avestur was normally too savvy to telegraph his personal allegiances, and she had the uncomfortable feeling that she was about to get thrown into waters that were beyond her ability to navigate.

“Sir?”
