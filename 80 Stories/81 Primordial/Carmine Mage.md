### Blurb

When "Carmine" wakes up in an unfamiliar city between the corpse of a high-ranking Priest of Valor and a sleeping panther, she can't remember anything. Certainly not how she wound up magically linked to a war-god’s angelic beast.

Carmine must flee for her life or face the vengeful [[Cult of Valor]] on charges of murder and theft. The panther’s power alone isn't enough, but it's what Carmine needs to discover her own inherent magic. Together, they escape and uncover a terrible truth: her beast is no angel. The panther is [[Masi]], the husband she sacrificed her memories to rescue.

High Priest [[Azer]], intent on creating a golden age of conquest, has learned how to transform captive mages into mindless, voiceless batteries. Carmine is the only sane mind-mage still free enough to fight. Trouble is, toppling Valor’s temple may destroy the people she is trying to save: [[Masi]] and their fellow mages, brainwashed by Azer’s magic into guarding the very priests stealing their power.

She could rescue Masi and flee the city in search of a free mage to restore his human form. Or, she can abandon the man she has come to love as both faithful husband and loyal beast. It is the only way to bring down Azer and end his warmongering cult for good.
