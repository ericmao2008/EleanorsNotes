Tagg didn't normally bother with the complicated rig designed to turn gallompfries from riding mounts into beasts of burden. The big, low-slung brutes didn't like the leather gear, unless they wore it often enough they learned to ignore it, like the saddles. An unbroken nichtdonts was as fractious as a cat with a scarf around her waist and twice as dangerous, but Taggg preferred them to his neighbors' horses. The same agility that made a risk of their temper gave made them in the mountains, and he'd had years to become comfortable with their quick, waddling gait. 

His sister frowned at him as he passed by the garden she was weeding. "Be careful. They say raiders attacked the Wright boy not a week ago when he was out riding alone, and people are a lot fonder of him a lot more than they are you."  He liked her best like this, worried about nothing more frightening than the empty plains, with dirt under her fingernails and the sun glinting off of her golden-brown hair. There had been a time when she'd kept them fed with her carefully-manicured beauty, and he was glad they had been able to find other ways to get by. She had a talent for separating herbs from the weeds that he, despite his sense of the land, had difficulty matching. 

"Just because people aren't happy about us bringing nichtdonts west doesn't mean they're going to try to kill me." Tagg forced himself not to roll his eyes, instead offering her as reassuring smile as he could manage. "Don't worry so much. Besides, I'll sense anyone coming long before they reach me."

Donna responded with a baleful glare. "That doesn't mean you'll have the sense to avoid them." 

He laughed. "I'll be careful. I promise."

"You'd better be. If you get hurt because of your own damn pride, I'm not going to heal you." 

She'd been making some variation of that claim since he was a boy. It was even less true now than it had been then. "Someone needs to go up and repair that road, and it'll take me half as long as anyone else, if they even bother. I'll be back before you know it."

She sighed, but nodded and turned back to tending the patch of rampion. Tagg signaled his mottled 'lomp forward, keeping her at a walk until they were beyond sight of the main house and outbuildings. Then he nudged her into a run and they headed up toward the spring pasture, dust forming a rooster tail behind them. 

Heavy, oppressive air signaled an approaching thunderstorm more clearly than the rain he could feel beginning to fall along the southern edge of his sensory range, far beyond the boundaries of the ranch. Worst case scenarios skidded through his mind as he rode across the plain -- floods, mudslides, his whole herd drowning. Though he knew the rain was needed, it would distract his senses as each droplet added static to the patterns of the world.

Knowing it would soon be much more difficult, he checked the herd. All twenty nichtdonts seemed to be resting in the shallows of one of the muddy, mineral-rich pools they preferred. He relaxed a little in the saddle. 

Scrub bushes and lone trees broke the monotony of the plains, casting darker shade than the clouds above. When he reached the foothills of the Andrean mountains, the trees grew taller and thicker. Ruts and cutaways began to mar the road between towns where recent rains had washed it out. Tagg missed the paved streets of his homeland, but set aside his nostalgia and promised himself that if the ranch had a good year, he'd start improving the local infrastructure. Just then, it wasn't worth it to do more than keep the roads passable. There were too many other things to spend time and money on.

 After dismounting, he looped the lomp's reins around one of the broken fence posts bordering the road. She made herself a dusty shallow to lay in, lowering herself enough for him to reach the bags hanging from her wide back. After putting on heavy rawhide gloves to protect his hands from thorns and splinters, he surveyed the fallen bodark trees in the middle of the road.
He sensed ground squirrels digging tunnels and deer lying down to hide from the midday sun, but the second time he snagged his gloves on one of the vicious thorns that made the trees so good for the fences cowherds preferred for protecting their herds, he decided to focus on the task at hand. Despite his promise to his sister, he didn't realize that the hoofed animal coming his way might be a horse carrying a person until they dismounted, heeled boots digging into the ground. Horses were still foreign to him, despite the years since their westward move. 
Tagg looked up from the fallen trees to see Jenson Wagner stalking toward him, righteous fury in every line of his expression. "So this is how you've been stealing my cows."
With more care than the task warranted, Tagg set aside a thorned branch and drew himself up to his full height. "If you've come all the way out here to accuse me of theft, you've wasted your time. I don't give a damn about your cows." 
Jenson sneered. "Bullshit. Everybody knows nichtdonts only live in the Cawdine mountains. You want to stay here, you're going to need cows. You've been cutting holes in the fences to steal mine."
Bewildered, Tagg followed his gaze to the pile of discarded bodark. As he realized what Jenson was implying, he laughed. "I'm fixing the road, you ass. Why would I break your fences?" He hadn't even noticed it, since his own herds weren't given to stampedes or wandering off the way cows were, and would just burrow under the thorns if they were in the way.  
A red flush colored Jenson's cheeks. "It's not as though you paid for your land anyway. Why buy cattle when you can steal them, right?" 
Tagg's fingers tightened into fists, straining against the confines of his thick gloves. "I'm getting tired of hearing that pack of lies go around town, Jenson." 
"What lies? You won a hundred acres in a card game before anyone knew you had the landsense gift." Jenson hawked and spat, the spittle landing insultingly close to Tagg's foot. "I'm supposed to be surprised you'd steal six head from me?"
Tagg yanked off his gloves. "I didn't steal a fucking thing from anyone. I came up here to unblock the road. I thought you might like to be able to get to town sometime." With a sharp tug that caused her to hiss furiously, he reclaimed his lomp.
Janson's belligerence seemed to add ten pounds to his swagger. "Leave, and take your damn turtles with you. That will make me feel better." 
 The insult to his herd was childish, but Tagg's stomach still burned. Though he'd intended to go, being told to make him balk. The memory of Donna's admonishment pushed him to mount, and he forced himself to smile. "Make sure the road's passable when you're done with your precious fences." 
Having ridden all the way out anyway, Tagg decided to check on his own herd. Though landsense gave him an advaTaggge, an awareness of claw indentations, recent burrows and bodyweight wasn't the same as physically laying eyes on the roaming nichtdonts. While he resented being falsely accused, he didn't doubt for a moment that Janson was missing half a dozen of his herd. A cattle rustler probably wouldn't know what to do with one of his nichtdonts, but his position was too precarious to risk ruin for the sake of laziness.
Sensing his mood with the empathy particular to the breed, the lomp bolted. Tagg let her set the pace, directing her toward the watering hole where the herd had gathered. Field mice scrambled out of the way as her charging mass forced the spring grains to part. The green grasses slapped against his trousers hard enough to sting despite the thick cotton material. 
At first, the nichtdonts emerged as little more than divots in the distance where they lay in the grass, but his thudding approach chivvied the bony, armored beasts to their sickle-clawed feet and onto drier land where their armor could offer some protection. Rather than send them bolting, he reined in his mount. The milling nichtdonts settled some, but one stumbled onto her side and released a distressed squeal that led two of her sisters to approach from either side, interposing their armored flanks on either side of her vulnerable belly. 
Tagg's slow-burning frustration crystallized into churning anger as he looked around and realized how many of the nichtdonts were so listless that they hadn't bothered to startle at his approach. Though there were few predators who could damage their tough, bony plates, he couldn't leave them. 
Gathering his magic to his core, he released a flare of emerald light into the sky, signaling to Donna: emergency.

Tagg thought he had identified the source of the nichtdonts' lethargy by the time his sister arrived, dress hiked up above her knees and soaked to translucence. Her gallompfry's sides heaved with effort as she dismounted, but her eyes were fresh and alert despite the ride. "Someone poisoned the pond," he shouted over the pouring rain. "It's subtle, but about half of them are too dizzy to stand. They kept falling when I got them out of the mud." 
Donna wiped the streaming water from her eyes and appraised the herd. "Is that why you've got the water lit up?" The dark glow barely offered enough illumination to see by, obscured as it was by the rain pooling atop the foul, magicked pond. 
"I didn't want the storm to dilute whatever's in there, and I definitely didn't want them to keep drinking it." 
Donna nodded and approached the females closest to the water's edge. "You'll need to check the other watering holes, but the rain is good. The puddles will keep them hydrated while we figure out what's going on."
Tagg offered a grim snort as he started wiping down his sister's mount. "I know what's going on. Someone is trying to cause trouble. Janson is missing six head of cattle. He thinks I took them."
"He's a jackass." Still, she was practical. "You checked to see if they're wandering about?"
"I didn't have anything better to do, waiting for you to get here." Except to set up a spell to contain the contaminated water, and another to keep the rain from falling on the herd. He rubbed the ache in his right temple. Casting that much magic hurt, but losing the herd would hurt more. He had worked too hard to let a cold rain be the difference between healthy nichtdonts and dead ones. The local cattle ranchers might hate him for it, but western townsfolk would pay a premium for the fresh, exotic meat and armor he could provide. 
They needed that money. A major setback now, with their coffers so close to empty after seasons of waiting for the herd to mature, would devastate them. 
Without concern for her clothes, Donna knelt in the mud beside a listless nichtdont. She rested her palms on either side of her club-like snout. "Are you sure his cows are actually missing?" 
"He's not that good of a liar." Tagg wrung out the rag and laid it over a stirrup to drip dry  "I've played primero with him, remember?" 
Donna huffed out a distracted laugh. The bluish-purple glow around her hands flared brighter for a half-second before she got her gift under control. "You'll play cards with anyone who will sit still long enough." 
"Maybe I should invite some of the neighbors over for a friendly game to see if they know anything about what's going on. Janson and I can't be the only ones running into trouble. "
"No one is going to take an offer for a 'friendly' game of cards seriously, Tagg." The young female she was working with released a distressed squeak and crawled awkwardly to feet better adapted for digging than wading through mud. "You spent too long as a card shark to turn it into a social event now." 
"Well I'm not going to regret it," Tagg snapped, stung. "It paid for this ranch, and all those dresses you insisted you needed."  
"And how many did I have to leave behind?" Donna shook her head sharply. "Nevermind. We've both done unsavory things; they had to be done. I'm not going to throw stones. But if you want to find out what's going on, primero isn't the way."
Deflated, Tagg sighed. "What do you suggest? If I start showing up on their land asking questions, I'm going to wind up with arrows in my ass." 
"Don't be melodramatic. They don't all hate you." 
"Enough do, and nobody is happy with how Grant sold me the land. At least a few were hoping to buy it for themselves."
"For cheaper than you were willing to pay. It's been years. They'll get over it."
He snorted. "People don't like me as much as they like you, Donna." 
"Fine, you big whiner. I'll call on Janson and the Wights and see what I can come up with.But that's not going to be enough."
Tagg nodded. "I know. Someone needs to keep a closer eye on the herd, and I've got too much going on. Losing a nichtdont here and there to a broken leg or a particularly adventurous bear isn't going to break us, but we can't afford to have something  like this happen again." 
Donna sobered and the dark glare around her hands faded as she pulled her magic back. "I'm not sure we could afford this. Another couple of hours and we'd have lost a lot more than Janson's six head. I think I know what's wrong with them, and it's not poison."
It didn't matter if he was wrong about the cause. If Donna couldn't heal them, the herd would be decimated and they would be destitute again. Bile tickled the back of his throat. "I don't care what it is. Can you fix it?"
"Look at her snout, do you see the little lesions on the skin? There are more on her feet."
Tagg curbed his impatience and followed her finger with his gaze. The small abrasions were almost invisible to his naked eye, but he knew that if he didn't look, Donna wouldn't explain. "I didn't think nichtdonts could get cuts like that through their armor. Something that small can't be what's hurting them. I've seen nichtdonts hunt with crushed legs before."
"There are a few places they aren't protected, but it's not a cut. I thought maybe they were cuts at first that had gotten infected, but no. She's sick. You can't tell just by looking at her, but her blood's too thin, too, and her joints are inflamed."
Tagg wasn't a mender, but he knew what a long litany of symptoms meant for healing. His stomach sank to his feet. "Can you fix it?"  
She hesitated for a few seconds too long. "Maybe, but not if I have to keep house and entertain on top of it. You're going to have to hire help."
Tagg closed his eyes and took a deep breath to settle his nerves. Panic wouldn't solve the problem. "What kind of help? I was thinking of finding someone to watch the herd, but I'd have to train them, and finding someone we can trust is going to be hard."
"I'll stay with the herd, but I can't do that and take care of things back at the house."
It was better than trying to find someone who knew how to work with nichtdonts and wouldn't cause trouble out of spite, but he hated the idea of his sister camped alone on the plains with nothing but sick beasts for company.  "Can we afford to hire someone?"
She shrugged. "We can't afford not to, if the ranch is going to function." She pasted on a cheerful smile. "Besides, if enough of the herd dies, we'll be so screwed one person's wages won't matter anyway."

"Why should I trust you? This could kill me and solve all of your problems."
"Hardly, Anna. If you die, your people will blame me, and I'll never be able to end the war. You want the border raids to stop. I understand. But don't get so wrapped up in being the one who solves the problem that you make it worse instead of better."
She didn't sputter, but her eyes narrowed dangerously and Tagg had to stop himself from taking a step back. "How dare you?" she demanded with quiet intensity.
Tagg stared at her for a moment, then gently said, "You know how to get ahold of me when you're ready."

"You resonate at violet. You have an army! Trained men. A castle. We'll do anything. Taxes. Tithes. My daughter--"
Tagg winced and held up a hand. "I'm sorry. I can't help you. This isn't my land."
"It could be! We'll sell it to you. Pennies on the dollars if you'll let us stay. Please." 
"I don't need more land. I don't even need more people." 
"Then why did you agree to this meeting?" Anger warred with the confusion in his voice.
Because it felt cowardly to let a funky deliver the message that he couldn't -- wouldn't -- help. "I don't need more people, but we'll find a place for you if you want to relocate onto my land, where I can protect you."
The anger faded from his eyes. "This farm has been in my family for generations. We're farmers."
"Then I suggest you surrender to Anna. She won't raze your farm. Her soldiers won't rape your daughters. Your life won't change all that much. You're too old for her to conscript you."
"My daughters aren't."
Tagg raised his eyebrows. He hadn't heard that Anna had begun conscripting women, too. He didn't know why he was surprised. Clearly, she didn't think women were too weak for the battlefield, and no sensibilities were going to interfere with her plan to conquer the East. She was practical that way. "You'll send them to me, but not Anna?"
The farmer tightened his lips. "You wouldn't have taken them all."
More likely, the offer had been made as an indicator of his seriousness -- desperation -- he hadn't expected Tagg to accept it. 
Abruptly, Tagg wished he'd let his sister handle this meeting. He'd strayed too far from the main point and was just wasting time. There were enough problems without adding the farmer's to his plate. "I'm sorry. I can't take your land. I can't afford to, not and protect my own. You'll need to decide what to do. Talk it over with your daughetsr. Stay and join the army, or come here and lose the farm."
Tagg knew what decision he would have made -- the decision his mother had in her own way made. But it was the farmer's choice. 
He stood. There was nothing to be gained by indulging the man anymore. 

"You've taken others under your protection. Why not him?" X asked quietly after the farmer had gone.
"I meant what I said," Tagg told X. "I can't protect his farm."
"Why not? It's right on your border, this side of the mountain. Tactically, the location is ideal. That valley isn't any harder to patrol than any of the others."
"Even I have limits. I've reached them. If I'm hoe, I can sense the Laeia mountains. I can tell you how many fish are in Mallory lake. There's a fox in the western wood that's eating a rabbit. But I can't tell you anything about that farm. I won't claim what I can't hold."
"Why does it matter? You can't get word there fast enough to matter, and if you need to know about the far, you can just ride half an hour east. You'd hardly be the first noble to hold land beyond what they can sense, even if that doesn't usually happen to Princes. You spent most of your life holding less than what you can sense." 
"It's not about the gift. It's about the magic. Besides, this isn't really about Anna's army, not for me. Sure, she's a threat to a farm or a barony, but I don't think she's going to invade us. We're not a chunk she can absorb into her empire. War with us is contrary to everything she claims to stand for."
X looked doubtful.
