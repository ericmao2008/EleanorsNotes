Another day, another fool. %% Pov of a Temple Priest of [[The Counselor]] %%

%% need to add more tension by following the Mary Robinette Kowal structure, this is just a sketch. More adversarial with the father? More of a "I want to go home and you're after hours" kind of tone?" %%

Jonei put the paperwork for $egregious thing$ away and in walked a powerful lord and a boy — his son, to judge by the resemblance. %% describe better. %%

"He's not a thaumaturge, if that's what you're thinking," Jonei said. 

The noble looked briefly surprised, then offered a crooked smile. "No, I suppose that would have been too much to ask for. No, I want him evaluated for a position 

Jonei raised an eyebrow normally they wouldn't be at the temple because powerful people don't usually have trouble finding jobs for their kids. %% see also: [[Nahrian social stratification]] discussion. %%

"Before I start, it would help if I knew what you wanted for yourself," Jonei said to the boy.  %% name is [[50 Worldbuilding/60 Characters/b. 200-299 ATF/Oenipe]]. %% Aptitudes mattered, but Counselors were taught to take preference into account for a reason. The best job placements were those that put children somewhere they not only had the ability to succeed, but the desire. 

"He can't talk," %% can't understand because he was raised elsewhere? some other disability maybe? I'd like him to ultimately end up as a spotter aboard a small trading boat %% 

Ah. "That's okay, sir. I'm a Counselor." 

She focused on the boy's mind. 

%% Something surprising? %% 

I don't want to be important. 

Sorry, son. Everything worth doing is important for something. 

He doesn't want anything from you. 

He blames you for the death of his mother? No. His girlfriend thinks being a lords son makes him unsuitable to marry. He loves her enough to reject my support. 

Not all of it. He let you bring him here. 

I love my son. I'm not going to stand in the way of his happiness. 

Is the girl worth it? Why can't he find work with her people? 

He wants to prove he's a man. Do it in his own. 

Nobody does anything on their own. We're a community. This is civilization. This is foolishness. Tell that to your girl. If she doesn't want you for who you are, she doesn't want you. 

But if you want my opinion, you'll be happiest on a ship. Far away from the girl and your father. 

there's no shame in asking your father to help you find a place. Lots of folks fill positiona without coming to the counselors temple. But of you're determined not to go that route, I can put you on a ship bound for the mainland tomorrow morning. 

You'd be good at lookout work.

%% Origin story for the winged people in [[The Cliff Test]]. This is how their island comes to Verraine? A Realmwalker forms it with magic out of the earth's crust. and creates the winged people to "distill" aether into crystals via their blood (per [[how enchanting works in Verraine]]) %% 

[[Oenipe]] was not the sharpest member of his age-set. He was not the swiftest runner or the strongest hauler or even the kindest teacher. 

But when you needed a man who could stare out into nothingness for hours at a time and not only stay alert but not resent the task, there were none better, and Captain Snyder was pleased enough with Jacon's character that he hoped to bind the boy to his daughter come spring. 

%% This probably shouldn't be the intro of the story. It's just a segment. The inspiration is [[Beyond the Blue Horizon by Brian Fagan]] / placed by [[The Counselor]] Temple. Set after the Unification of Maehlorn and [[Counseling flash]] is the preceding story — same character. %% 

* Spot land where none should be
* Oenipe sounds the depths %% ( see also: [[2021.03.22 Boating]] ) %%
* Is the island the rsult of a volcano? Or magic war? Basically both? 
* Decision: to make landfall, or not? 
	* Do it, of course. Could be treasures worth trading, or pristine land for settling...
	* or monsters, of course. But they can always flee back to see. 
		* Famous last words! The monsters fly. 


* End: Oenipe stays behind? Negotiate ship repairs? Kill off some of the attackers and narrowly escape? Using Oenipe's patience / trap / fishing method/skills (bait).
