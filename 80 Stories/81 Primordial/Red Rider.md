- [I] Outline
	- write a [[Swordwulfen]] story loosely riffing off of Little Red Riding Hood except also a [[soldiers quartered in private homes]] story. The idea would be to have it mostly be about the aspect that Swordwulfen are elite soldiers. 
	- The woodsman hero saves Red from an amorous Swordwulfen attacking her (should this be the "fated mate" thing, because it's _biology_ and her _biology_ is that she'd actually be able to carry the child to term?) when she goes to take food to her grandmother's house. 
	- She's mostly just visiting and bringing word from family, like an aunt that married into another village, and bringing lunch with her so her presence isn't a burden on her elderly grandmother. But she discovers that the Swordwulfen is already putting a big burden on her grandma, when she gets there. 
	- Red is a sheperd's daughter, but this is related to [[Swordwulfen and Delia]], taking place in the same location, so basically everyone would have red clothes — people usually call her the Red Rider (not Red riding Hood) because she's from Redbrook and a Rider, which is essentially an informal circuit judge / law giver, a la the #pkm/crossReference this with the article I found about widows being forced to marry their brotehr in law and the old ways in the mountains having to fight against Sharia law. Theorietcally I linked it to the [[2021.11.01 Marriage]] newsletter. 
	- In this society, maybe all judges are lesbian women? It makes the woodsman angle less of a romance, which is probably a good thing.

The Red Rider had been born with the somewhat unlikely name of Rhiannon, a fact she was able to forget a surprising majority of the time. 

This was not one of those times. 


Though she rode into Redbrook on one of the legendary fyrpwnies, it came as no surprise to be addressed by her childhood nickname. 

"Headed to see your grandma, Rhee?" Dhomi the ferryman asked as she led her horse onto the battered old boat. 

She'd been raised in Redbrook, after all, for all that she'd been born in the city of ==where?==, nearly twenty leagues to the east. 

"That's the plan," Rhiannon agreed, smiling as she secured the horses reins to a splintered old post. She remembered when it had been so new she could smell the varnish. "Anything I should know?" 

Soldiers from [[Edarebia]] had burned the old ferry during the [[Salted Wars]] after old Mister Staln got caught smuggling the town's namesake dies past the new taxmen. 

Staln was lucky the taxmen hadn't killed him outright, but he'd been forced to find new work, and last she'd heard he was still a crewman on one of the big tradeships that ported out of ==where?== 

Not that she'd heard anything in years. Most of the gossip people shared with her was focused closer to home. 

"Jannie's sister runs the bakery now," Dhomi said. "If you were planning to stop in for lunch, get one of the pies." 

"Kat?" Kat had always loved the woods; it wouldn't surprise Rhiannon to learn that she spent half her days gathering berries up in the hills, after the bakery closed. "Funny to think of her stuck in that hot old building all day. But thank you, I like the idea of having lunch with Grams before I check in with the elders to see if there's anything I can help with." 

It would be the third time she'd visited family in as many years; her duties as a Rider kept her busy and rarely brought her home. 

"Tell her I said hi," Dhomi said cheerfully once they reached the other wise of the river, and Rhiannon promised she would. 

- [!] this needs to be edited because why wouldn't Dhomi tell her about the Swordwulfen? Does he not know?

In addition to pronouncing laws and otherwise helping keep the peace, Red Riders often carried messages and packages between. It was such a package that had brought her home to Redbrook. 

Rhiannon suspected that the only reason the Edarebians permitted them to exist at all was that the Riders were all young women, and for some reason they seemed to think that young women with no real possessions beyond their cloaks and their horses could possibly be a real threat. 

She didn't even carry a weapon, unless you counted her belt knife or her handaxe, neither of which had ever harmed anything more biologically complex than a willow tree. 

Besides, it wasn't as though the Riders went out of their way to present themselves as a threat. Quite the opposite. 

They'd done their best to act like simple outcasts, unwanted spinsters — and somehow the Edarebian conquerors never noticed the subtle influence the Riders exerted. 

They hadn't been able to keep the Swordwulfen from claiming their land, after all, and to the court of Edarebian mages, the taxes were all that mattered. 

Rhiannon suppressed a twinge of bitterness. Preventing conquest had never been the job of the Riders. Theirs was a support role — they kept the peace. They carried messages. 

They were all that was left after their counterparts, the ==gay mages? something #fic/expandWorldbuilding here== had been annihilated by the Swordwulfen.

"I know remember how important it was to you not to marry," he said. The life of a Rider was a hard one; the cloak was a symbol of prestige, yes, but it was also often the only blanket, pillow, or bed she ever got. Taking it up meant she'd never have another home to go to. 

The Swordwulfen was an elite killing machine, but he made no effort whatsoever to learn anything about the population  he was oppressing. Why would he? His was the dominant force, and they were already making over [[Nythymra]] in [[Edarebia]]'s image. 

Her grandmother's house was one of the smaller ones in town, but it was near the river and the adjacted woods had been neatly coppiced for generations. 

- [?] Is this contemporaneous to [[2021.10.06 The laundress & the fungal growth (FF)]]? Maybe a year or so after? Where does this fit into the [[Surzi]] storyline? 

With the war long over, the mages had firmly settled themselves in the bigger cities, where there were enough amenities to keep them from screaming boredom.

- [?] why is the Swordwulfen here at all? He's an elite soldier, and a tracker, and a guard — he specializes in pure violence, he's not a spy. Is there a rebellion being formented? Is he hunting witches for mages to bleed because female mages are considered evil and only fit for bleeding? Is this a prequel to [[2021.11.03 The Impossible Knife (SS)]]?
