When the sun was shining through the big bay windows and the birds were chirping their spring morning songs, Anjilena could almost forget she was locked in the attic of her new employer's house. 

It wasn't an ugly room, really. The thick plaster walls were painted bright and cheery yellow, which did an impressive job of hiding the thick iron bars of her cage. She'd found them on the second day, when she finally managed to break through the wall with a brass candlestick she'd found in one of the old crates. 

She finally got tired of staring at the hole -- it was depressing, really -- and covered it with a big oval mirror. When she tossed an old dress over her head (it smelled nice, like cedar) and looked at herself in its yellow-silver glass, she almost looked like a painting. 

"I still can't believe he left me up here with all this stuff," she said, shaking her head as she stripped off the dress. Pretty as it was, the lace was scratchy on her neck, and she hadn't yet found a sewing kit with which to fix it. 

"He doesn't want you to be bored," said a woman's voice. 

Anjilena screamed. She turned toward the voice and backed away from it in the same awkward motion, nearly tripping herself on a buckled baseboard. 

There was no one there but herself, staring back at herself from the mirror. 

Anjilena watched in horror as her mouth moved in the yellow-silver glass.

"Don't worry," she watched herself say. "You aren't going mad." 

Anjilena slapped her hands over her mouth, but the woman in the mirror just smiled. 

"It's magic, dear. Not much magic left in this part of the world, but there's enough."

"Magic?" Anjilena squeaked. "But that's just a story." 

"I suppose it must seem like that to you, dear." Her doppleganger laughed bitterly as she tested the width of her waist and hips. "You're, what, seventeen? Never left your village, I'd bet. At least not before Finth got his hands on you."

The name refocused Anjilena on what really mattered: getting out of this dusty, gilded prison. "What do you know about Finth?" 

"Ah, my. What I know about Finth wouldn't fill a thimble, girl. He was never fool enough to look me in the eye, as it were. Likes collecting trinkets, I'm told."

"Trinkets like you?" 

"Trinkets like _you,_" the mirror corrected her. "I'm afraid magic mirrors are rather more uncommon than pretty farmgirls with a curious streak and a penchant for busting holes in perfectly fine walls."

"It's a prison!" Anjilena exclaimed. "There's nothing fine about it." 

"Well. I suppose I admire your gumption. But you'd be better off to wait. You'll be out of here soon enough." 

Anjielan put her hands on her hips, and nothing testing about it. "I'm not going to sit and wait around for him to come back." She refused to think about the unspeakable things a man might do to a woman her age if he had her under his control. 

The woman in the mirror shrugged. "On your head be it, but I'd like to remind you that I'm a _magic_ mirror, girl." 

"For all I know he left you in here just to torment me," Anjilena muttered. She tossed the old dress over the mirror and turned back to the boxes.

By sunset she was so exhausted her arms shook. Dust coated every strand of hair from tip to root, even the little ones in her nose. Her 

"Hey," whispered a voice from the mirror. 

"Shut up," Anjilena barely managed to push the words past her exhaustion. 

The mirror clattered to the ground. An arm stuck through the hole in the wall, followed by a man's unruly mop of thin braids. "Hey is somebody in here?" 

Anjilena squeaked. "Who are you?" 

The head tilted up, revealing the bright, mischevious eyes of a boy her own age. "Call me Sten, miss. Noticed the walls. Noticed the bars. Considered that maybe you don't want to be here, ey?" 

"No," Anjilena said, forcing her tired legs to support her weight, cursing the mirror for the uselessness of its advice. Even if it had told her outright that rescue was coming, she wouldn't have believed it. "No, I don't. Can you get me out?" 

"Sure thing, ma'am," he said with a rakish grin, and tugged on the bars. 

They bent. 

Anjilena gasped. "How are you so strong?" 

A feral yellow light rolled over his eyes. "Magic, miss. Come on, there's no time to waste. He'll be back soon."
