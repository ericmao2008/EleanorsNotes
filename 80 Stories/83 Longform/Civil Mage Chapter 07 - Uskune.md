## Summary

<!-- 
goal: get medical care
conflict: the army doctor refuses to work on a biladiyn and refuses to acknowledge her rank because she's Voldshee? 

A higher authority finally arrives, but instead of Lupicin, it's her rival from the Marna Temple of the Architect who left after a conflict with [[Irella]] -- she views Irella as hacving driven her out of Marna and resetns her. **

This was a setup! She orders Alem to return to Marna and offerse her very own *biladiyn* as a protecter, so Irella can't really refuse but is abruptly without her most trusted protector. -->

## Notes

### Edit Letters

- [ ] Address the fact that her guard got injured. 
- [ ] Lupicin tries to establish dominance. If he can't get her cooperation, best to establish authority.  
- [ ] "Irella had a difficult time getting a handle on Lupicin. Of Eramepi's seven generals, he was one of the three she had never met." 

### Chapter 07 

The Archivist's cart was slower than walking, but with Alem tucked in tight with the letters and packages, Irella and her *biladiyn* made good time to Uskune. The gate guard offered directions to the camp's hospital tent, and ==Archivist== turned his ox toward the hospital. 

"Can you go on ahead and let the ==doctor== know w're bringing him a patient?" Irella asked Enduca.

"No," Alem said. 

Irella cursed mentally; she'd thought Alem was asleep. "I'm perfectly safe," she said in a low voice. It wouldn't do to argue in front of the other *biladiyn* — or the garrison. "We're in the middle of camp!" 

"Exactly," Alem shot back, just as quietly. "You're in the middle of a thousand armed men who might take exception to a woman who looks Voldshee wandering through their camp."

Irella recoiled. Part of her had been so happy to be back in an army camp -- altough she'd never actually *fought* in the unification war, she had traveled with Eramepi and had basked in the gratitude most soldiers felt for the fortifications she'd built, the bridges and fords that had made their lives easier. 

That part of her had relaxed as soon as she passed through the gates. Uskune's army camp, almost as much as the docks at Marna, had felt like homecoming after a season among vipers at the capitol. At least partially because she felt more at ease with mountains on the horizon and the scent of snow on the breeze. 

But Alem was right — she wasn't safe here. Though a bog standard typical Nahrian camp <!-- describe it -->, none of the soldiers here knew her. Eramepi had done his best to keep her away from Lupicin's army. 

<!-- this is too much space between dialog, going to need to condense it --> Still, Irella wavered. 

"I appreciate your concern," Alem said.  "But a minute or so's extra prep time isn't going to make much difference to my recovery." 

"Fine," Irella said. "But let's hurry." 

In short order, they found themselves in the military hospital tent. It was emptier than Irella had expected given the size of the garrison and the presence of Monche raiders in the region. 

Brawls and accidents had accounted for more soldiers in the healing tents during peace/downtime before the unification war broke out. 

{speculation?}
