## [[Temple Mage|Temple Mage]] Blurb
When a traveling priest identifies [[Kia]] as a fellow mage, she thinks her newfound gifts are enough to save her family from starvation. Part of becoming an adult is learning that solutions are rarely so simple. The river that sustains her village is drying up, and her raw, untrained power proves too weak to stop the desert from closing in.

Her best hope is the distant [[Temple of Tef]]. In better times, her people tithed baskets of fish and grain. Now, she has only herself to offer. If she masters her magic in service to the gods, maybe she can convince the High Priest to aid the forgotten faithful.

Unfortunately, even the lofty Temple is not immune to greed. While working to expand the Temple’s influence, Kia discovers unthinkable corruption. High Priest [[Tenry]] has secretly sold the grain that should have gone to feed her family. Instead, it has helped the armies of the Cult of Valor cross the growing desert. Now, only the proudest of the poor desert tribes stand between the invaders and Kia’s people.

Kia must stop the expansionist cult, but how? She could abandon her vows and join the desert dwellers in defending her home, but she is only one mage. To win the Temple to her cause would cost precious time her family does not have. Kia must decide whether to trust the magic that has failed her before — or the ancient promises of her ancestors’ gods.
