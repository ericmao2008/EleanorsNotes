## [[Civil Mage|Civil Mage]] Query

[[60 Characters/b. ATA 100-199/Irella]], a priestess able to channel the raw power of the divine, has devoted her life to bringing peace and prosperity to her adopted land. Though her innovations in architecture and infrastructure allowed the new Sovereign to unite the warring city-states of Lysaria, she is  denigrated for her barbarian birth and forced to act from the shadows. When the Sovereign dies of fever,  she is left without a protector and finds herself banished for the crime of inconveniencing the wrong rival priest during a sewer renovation. 

Though a noble ally from her days working alongside the Sovereign's army begs her to come north and work for him, she is unwilling to risk becoming the flashpoint that causes the League to collapse. [[60 Characters/b. ATA 100-199/Irella]] follows her orders to travel to the hinterlands and assist with an upcoming [[Uskune trade fair|trade fair]]. If the fair is successful, it will solidify the new [[Valentia|new Sovereign's]] reign enough for Irella to return to work over the objections of the purist Temple faction. But an [[Lupicin|usurper]] is determined to conquer their entire island in pursuit of cultural hegemony, and to stop him, Irella must come to understand — and trust — the uncivilized [[Monche Nomads|nomads]] whose annual raids left her orphaned in a foreign land. 

Civil Mage is a 90,000 word bronze-age fantasy with series potential. It will appeal to fans of _the Imager Portfolio_ by L. E. Modesitt, Jr. and can best be compared to K.J. Parker's _Sixteen Ways to Defend a Walled City_ and Evan Winter's _The Rage of Dragons_.

## Casual

So, my protagonist is a bronze-age "civil engineer" who trained her magic in the Temple of the Architect. "The Architect" is basically the god of cities. When her Sovereign, who she's worked closely with to help unite the warring river valley city-states dies, she's sent off to the hinterlands because the new Sovereign doesn't think she has the political capitol to protect the protagonist, who the elites don't like, basically because she's an immigrant from another culture who is laser-focused on things like "stopping border raids" and "making the cities livable for the common people" and not, you know, improving their palaces and playing politics with them. 

In the hinterlands she uncovers a plot between the general there and a religious faction that is basically willing to prostitute the "building good cities" part of their religious mandate because they think they have a religious mandate to "purify and spread their culture" that's more important. The protagonist has to stop them in order to save the (not actually awful, just in a bad spot politically) Sovereign, keep everything from devolving into a bunch of genocidal wars, and not incidentally prevent a plague.

## < 100 words

A bronze-age "civil engineer" (priestess-mage) who was born a "barbarian" and raised in "civilization" has devoted her life to putting an end to the constant raids that killed her parents. But when her Sovereign dies, she's shuffled off to the hinterlands... where it turns out her new commander is staging a revolution. He's being helped by priests who think it's better "purify" and proselytize than keep to their Gods' precepts: like building healthy cities worth living in. Irella has to work together with some of the local tribes to keep them from committing genocide—starting with her.
