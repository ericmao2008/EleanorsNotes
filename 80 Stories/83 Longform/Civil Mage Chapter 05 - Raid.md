- [ ] Add:  "We need to get off the road." / Alem thinks she's being sensible and trying to flee; instead she uses her magic.
- [ ] say it explicitly: If we hurry we can get there before the raiders. She was the siege breaker. If she could get to the town first, the attackers would have no hope of penetrating the town's defenses.
- [ ] Integrate: I still think that a soldier would have used the flare as a distraction or improvised weapon during the fight outside the city. Being outmanned like that, they would have tried anything at all, I think, to even the odds.
- [ ] She needs to use the bore holer spell on the nomads in [[Civil Mage Chapter 05 - Raid]]
- [ ] edit the fight with the Monche in scene [[Civil Mage Chapter 05 - Raid]] instead of hoping the town holds out until aid comes - this can draw censure, then "You want me to *let* them raid?"

# Chapter 05

As they walked toward the gate, Rimush pointed out recent improvements to the city. The new fountains in the western square were beautiful, although [[60 Characters/b. ATA 100-199/Irella]] would have opted for a shorter plume to widen the usable space in the square. The memorial garden that was destroyed during the siege had been completely rebuilt, and a new apartment complex butted up against the city walls. 

The north gate, which had also seen extensive repairs, stood open, the road beyond paved with atherok and bordered by gravel trenches. It was a good road, the central ridge perfectly graded for shedding water during the flood season though it was older than Irella and all her guards combined. 

It was strange to see so many market stalls sprawling out beyond the walls, covering ground that had been scored with chariot ruts and offal the last time she’d seen it. 
“Are you planning to commandeer a spot on one of the postal coaches?” Rimush asked. 

“No, we’ll walk. The coaches stop at every little crossroad’s village.”

Rimush smiled in relief. “You're like a lamed boar in those things. No visibility, totally at the mercy of the driver.” His accent was surprisingly guttural compared to most of the *biladiyn* she’d gotten to know over the years. 

Irella shook off the ghosts of memory that Marna evoked and approached the gate guard. “Has there been any word of raiders?” 

“Nothing unexpected,” the guard reported. “The Voldshee have been quiet, but people are nervous about the Monche. They say it was a dry spring.” 

“Thank you,” Irella said, and passed through the city gate. 

Without the wall to block her view, shacks and tents and pastures sprawled outward beyond the stalls for half a league. The people she passed had skin plump with ready food, clothes clean and untorn. By the time road climbed out of the river valley, Irella and the biladiyn were alone save for a lone onager grazing on the white-blooming grasses along the ridge. 

Irella stared at it for a long moment. They always looked like emaciated oxen to her, except for the mane and the lack of horns, which reminded her. “Have we seen any patrollers? Post runners?” 

Alem stiffened, frowning. “No and you’re right. We should have by now.” 

Half a league later, the road curved around a limestone outcropping and they caught up to a traveler also heading north — a young mother with a babe in arms and a hip-high child walking beside her. Irella stopped and called out a greeting. 

The woman looked exhausted. The youth, tear-stained and grubby, stumbled backwards when he noticed her.

"Please—" the woman stuttered, eyes wide with fear as she grabbed the boy’s shoulder and pulled him close. "We—"

Abruptly, Irella realized that the family had taken her group to be a small raiding party. Most farmers and local brigands preferred weapons that were more multipurpose; axes and scythes, the occasional bow or spear. Swords, like the ones the biladiyn wore, were uncommon and had only one purpose: killing.

Irella held out a hand to stop Alem when he tried to take up the guard position in front her. "I’m nin-Irella.” She kept her voice gentle and directed her words toward the child. “The biladiyn and I won’t hurt you.”

The woman’s brow furrowed. “The who?” 

Avestur hadn't been exaggerating when he explained the need for a local temple, if the farmers around Uskune were so poorly integrated into Lysaria that they didn’t recognize the Order’s operatives or the significance of the rich mahogany red of her damask robes. 

“I’m a Priestess of the Architect of Cities,” Irella said. “I build things, mostly. These are my guards. May I ask your name?” 

“Vira.” The woman’s voice trembled.  “What do you want?”

“Have you passed any patrollers?"

"N-no."

Irella frowned. "Have you been on the road long?"

The youth overcame his fright and overcompensated with belligerence. "Long enough." He had a sweet voice beneath the bravado. "We're going to visit Grandpere in Brookside."

Alem stepped forward. “Alone?” His voice was low and surprisingly gentle, but the woman barked a bitter laugh. 

"You think I'd be hauling my sons to town in the middle of the decan if I had a choice?" Suppressed hysteria thinned her voice and Irella could sense the brittleness of her composure.

Softly, Irella asked, “What happened?”

"The Monche raided our farmstead." The woman’s voice shook. "My husband was out tying up the new beans. I found him later, arrow through his chest. They took everything they could carry, even the wedding ties. Burned the barn, busted up the kitchens... ransacked everything but the cellars.”

“You hid?” Enduca asked.

The woman nodded, lips twisted in a crooked, bitter smile as she started to believe they weren't planning to hurt her. “The hatch blends in with the floor if you don't know what you're looking for, and I guess the star-cursed nomads don’t. Grass-eaters would rather pillage than take care of a place."

“I’m sorry.” The words were as useless now as they’d been when Irella was a child, but neither a second language nor the decade since losing her parents had offered a better way to phrase her empathy. “If I rebuild your barn, would that help?” It felt like a useless gesture, but she couldn’t just ignore two the plight of two children. She had been just like them, once, mourning the death of a parent and forced to give up the only home she'd ever known. 

Eramepi had helped her. It was her turn to pay it forward. 

Vira’s eyes ranged over Irella’s face. “If you were one of those Voldshee necromancers who could bring my husband back? Maybe that would help. But I don’t have any use for a builder right now. The Monche are raiding, the harvest is gone, and my sons are too little to help me with a farm.”

“No I’m not, Mama!” The little boy puffed out his chest and forced his posture as tall as he could manage. His eyes turned pleading. “Let her try.” 

Vira put her hand on the top of the boy’s head. “Hush, baby. We’re going to Grandpere’s, remember?” 

A bright red plume of smoke flared up over the hill pines, then exploded with a sharp sound that startled the infant into tears. 

Raid imminent. Send aid. 

Brookside expected attack. “You need to go to Marna,” Irella said. 

Rimush was already reaching in his pack for a relay flare. 

Vira stared at the smoke. “Ain’t no one for me in Marna,” she said, distress stretching her voice thin as she rotated the child against her chest and rocked him. 

“Go to the Temple of the Gardener. It’s the big, dome-shaped building at the center of the city. Ask for nin-Padima and tell her that nin-Irella sent you. Tell her that Brookside sent up a raid-flare.”

There was no comprehension in the woman’s expression. “What?” 

Rimush’s smile was almost as warm and gentle as a trained proselytizer's. “The Gardener sees to it that no Nahrian goes hungry. Ask for directions at the gate.”

The doubt in the woman’s eyes ran as deep as her fear. Irella had to earn her trust, or she would walk her sons right into a battle trying to get to safety. 

"Vira, you can’t take your boys to Brookside right now. That flare means the town is under attack. It won’t be safe.”

“Grandpere!” the boy screamed. He tried to lunge toward the town, but his mother caught him by the shoulder, holding the baby on her hip with the other hand. 

“I’m going to go try and help your grandpere,” Irella promised him. “But you’ve got to think of your little brother and your mother. Okay?” 

Alem looked startled, but he waited until Vira led her sons toward Marna before speaking in a low voice. "Our orders–"

Irella flashed him a bright, brassy smile as she waited for Rimush to finish lighting his flare. The fuse hissed and sputtered. "My orders are to support the proselytizers and show the local people the benefits of worshipping at the Temple of the Architect. Can you think of a better way to do that than to save a local town from attack?”

"Irella, we aren't army regulars. We aren't equipped to—"

“We have to try,” Irella snapped, and started running to forestall further argument. 

She ran as fast as she dared as she led the biladiyn up the highway slope until Brookside came into view. If she ran full out she’d exhaust herself before she reached Brookside, but the *biladiyn* matched her stride easily. If she made it to Uskune, she would need to make it a point to exercise more regularly. 

Down in the valley, the streets of Brookside were deserted. The angle of the wall hid any defenders standing behind it, but someone should have been there, working to repel the raiders who were already scaling the wall. Big enough to boast a market square and the distinctive wheel of a water mill, if only barely, the town should have been able to fend off an attack by ten nomads.

Irella scrambled off the road, trusting the biladiyn to match her as she dropped to the ground. Unlike the green valley below, the ridge was dry and hard, barely enough to sustain the scrubby tree she crawled behind. It wasn’t big enough to obscure the stark red of her robes, but she hoped that distance and the incline of the valley would be enough to keep any raiders from spotting her. 

Not that any of them seemed to be watching the ridge. 

“Still think we can help 'em?” Enduca wiped dirty hands on her sheepskin mantle. 

“Raiders should never have made it this far into Nahrian territory without running afoul of a patrol, even mounted,” Irella said, impotent rage a hot coal in her stomach. She had expected to have more time before the raiders actually arrived. “We can’t just let them ravage the town.” 

“Won’t be long 'til they make it over the wall,”  Rimush said. 

Irella wished she could ask him to come up with a plan. She’d never been in charge of strategy, during the war. She didn’t want to be, now. But *biladiyn* weren’t soldiers. Their only duty was to keep her alive. 

“We could try to draw them away,” Alem offered dubiously. 

Irella caught a flash of Lysarian orange as someone—a courier, that was the only thing that made sense—leaned out over the wall and jabbed downwards with a javelin, driving one of the raiders off the wall. An archer, still mounted on a tamed onager, fired back before the raider’s black-booted feet even touched the ground. 

The other four kept climbing, the rawhide of their lamellar armor only a few shades darker than the ochre of the aetherock wall. 

“You trying to die today?” Enduca asked Alem. “Got a wings for your belt you haven't told me about?” 

There wasn’t time to make the wall tall enough to present a danger to climbers, so instead Irella began the process of broadening the base. She squinted, shifting positions until her view of the wall was no longer obscured by the bushes on the ridge. With this much distance—seven furlongs was her best guess without using her surveying rod—she couldn’t risk an obstruction to her sight lines. 

As one, their mounts flinched backwards from the echo of aetherial power as it coalesced in place. It would take hours of concentration to manifest fully, but the onagers didn’t know that. Their cries of alarm echoed through the valley. 

Most animals hated aetherock. Monche onagers were no different, despite their reputation for uncanny intelligence and the connection they were rumored to share with their masters. One threw its rider clear out of the saddle as its shied. Another bolted right for the heights where Irella lay, its nostrils flaring frantically. 

The hazy orange of her aetherial wall faded as her attention wavered.

“Now they know you’re here.” Alem cursed in a low, frustrated undertone. “You’re too valuable as a hostage for them to just ignore.” 

“Lysaria can’t afford to let the Monche think this territory isn’t defended.” She dug her fingers into the dirt to stop the trembling and flashed a smile full of bravado. “Besides, they only know I’m somewhere.”

The courier popped his head up long enough to drive another raider off the wall. Emboldened by the archers' distraction, he threw his javelin, impaling the thrown raider through the stomach. 

The scream echoed off the hills, and the bolting onager redoubled its efforts to flee. 

“Come on, reign it in.” Dread coiled in her stomach as the onager kept coming right for her. No part of her training covered a moment like this, and she knew, then, just how insulated she had been as part of Eramepi’s army. 

Until this moment, she had thought of herself as veteran of war. She had marched beside Eramepi’s soldiers during the southern campaigns. She had stood beside them on the walls of Marna. She’d never held a weapon in her hand, and that thought made her reach for her surveying rod. 

Now, facing Monche raiders whose onagers, though smaller than the oxen, could still trample her with ease. She wondered if anyone would even care that she’d died, now that Eramepi was dead. 

“He spotted us.” Rimush’s sword was nearly soundless as he pulled it from its leather sheath and rolled up into a crouch. 

“Hiyooo, mage!” the raider shouted, as he got his mount under control and drew his bow. 

“We go for the mount first,” Alem said, levering himself up onto one knee. “Rimush, you’re with me. Enduca, someone needs to guard the priestess.”

“You think?” Enduca grunted as she crawled out in front of Irella, her sword clenched in her left hand. 

Before Irella could speak, Alem and Rimush shot forward, running full-tilt toward the pair of raiders, as fast as if they hadn’t just joined her on a mad dash toward Brookside. Irella held her breath, waiting to see if they could flank him before the other raiders intervened. 

All eight were mounted, now. They raced to join their tribesman on the ridge. 

Irella released her breath, slow and shaky, and tried to control the fear crushing her chest. The biladiyn were among the most well-trained individual fighters in all of Nahria. They could--

Die nobly, against thrice their number. She had to do something to even the odds. 

“Don’t let anyone shoot me,” she told Enduca, then focused her thoughts. entering the fugue state that let her commune with the divine. 

She pictured a wall below her the mountainside, perpendicular to her body, positioned between the second group of oncoming raiders and her guards.  The Architect couldn’t provide what she she didn’t clearly ask for, and His miracles took time to evoke, but even the illusory shadow of His will was power worth using. Aether coalesced into a nascent wall as the Architect’s divine power flowed through her and transformed into power mortals could perceive. 

In a normal battle, it would have been a weakness she railed against, a statement of intent that told the enemy where to focus their forces. Now, though, she was grateful that the Architect required her to announce their joint intent to the world. 

Eramepi had told her, once, that the threat of force could be as much of a weapon as his army itself. She hadn’t understood, until now. 

One of the nomads shouted something in a dialect she forced herself not to translate. She held the image of the wall in her prayers and nothing else could matter. She mumbled words of focus aloud, a meditative trick she hadn’t needed since childhood. “…height of a man with a handspan base; webs the size of a leaf…” 

Alem shouted in pain. An onager shrieked, a braying sound of rage and agony. Eight raiders charged the aetherial wall. She let the knowledge wash over her, like an eagle crossing over a pond; they barely rippled the surface of her thoughts. 

“…isosceles triangle tipped with a 5.7 degree angle…”

Three onagers refused to pass through the illusory wall, but the other five ignored it completely. Dust rose in their wake as they thundered toward her.

Enduca’s fingers, knife-sharp, dug into her shoulder. Her concentration shattered and with it, the coalescing wall. 

“You think there’s time for big gestures?” Enduca said. “Can you think smaller? Your god likes fortifications, yeah? Pits? Spikes?”

The Architect’s domain was building cities, but she’d be a hypocrite to correct the guard. She’d served Eramepi’s dream of uniting Lysaria with far more fervor than she’d focused on urbanizing its valley. 

The three onagers frightened by the wall regained their nerve and picked their way suspiciously up the side valley. If Enduca hadn’t interrupted, she could have…

She could have watched Alem and Rimush get picked off by archers before the Monche took her hostage. The five forward riders, only two furlongs away now, were already nocking arrows. 

Maybe this was her punishment. Eramepi was dead, but the Architect was eternal.

“My mother killed a man with a needle and you can’t lame a nomad's mount with all the Architect’s magic behind you?”  Enduca asked. 

Irella narrowed her eyes. Needles. 

Tiny, tiny spikes. 

Fortifications. 

Would the Architect permit her to create such a trap, to defend not a city or even a town, but the exposed position of one of His priestesses? En-Avestur would be appalled. 

Irella envisioned a thin line of five spikes, so thin they were translucent,  into the ground before the onagers out in front. Hopefully she’d guessed correctly about the density of the webbed lattice needed to keep them from collapsing under their own weight. The forty-five degree angle she’d chosen put a lot of pressure on the base. Aetherock was brittle by nature; she’d spent a month learning how to craft the little webs that made it stable enough to build with. 

It wouldn’t matter if the spikes were too thick to manifest before the riders passed where she’d placed them. 

The raiders rode in a ragged line, faster onagers with favorable terrain pulling out ahead. The three out in front rode over where she’d set the spikes, but they were too far away for her to see anything else. 

The riders kept coming.

“Dust of stars,” she cursed. Had the spikes failed to manifest properly? Collapsed under their own weight? Broken on impact with the nomads' armor?

The next two riders passed the point she’d chosen to fortify. Nothing happened.

A *biladiyn* warcry jerked her gaze to the east. 

Rimush was sprinting toward her. The onager lay dead. She couldn’t see its rider, but Alem sat grass in a puddle of blood on the grass, awkwardly nocking the raider’s bow. 

If there had been enough time to test the idea, to properly engineer the spikes, maybe she could have saved them. 

Irella closed her hand around her surveying baton, like it could protect her better than three *biladiyn*. 

The onager out in front, ridden by the raid leader, faltered. The two onagers to either side stumbled awkwardly to the ground, along with the two onagers behind them. The raid leader toppled to the side with his onager, momentum forcing a forward slide. Four riders slid bonelessly from their onagers. The fifth leapt free as his onager collapsed. 

“Didn’t expect that, did you, you goatfuckers?” Enduca flashed her a grin, then bolted to her feet and charged directly at the three remaining raiders just as they fired their first arrows. 

The arrows flew straight at Enduca and Rimush. Quick as thought, Irella begged the Architect to shield their path. She pictured a parchment-thin sheet of aetherock suspended in the air. It would shatter when hit, but maybe deflect the arrow’s path just enough to be useful. 

If it manifested fast enough. 

She channeled power into the vision and shrieked as divine fire seared her skin, the Architect’s retribution for her impudence in thinking she could channel so much of His power. She curled into a ball on the ground, fingers digging into her palms to fight the pain. 

It consumed her.
