### Chapter 06

The smell of smoke—burnsmoke, not a cookfire—snapped [[60 Characters/b. ATA 100-199/Irella]] back to consciousness. Enduca carried her like a sack of grain over one shoulder. Irella's flesh felt like she had bathed in acid. She whimpered like a child as Enduca shifted her grip in response to the stiffening of Irella's weight, though the pressure didn't add to her pain the way it would have if the Architect's retribution had been physical. 

"What happened to her?" she heard Alem demand from somewhere to her left. 

"The Architect finally rejected her barbarian ass." Rimush's response held more of a sneer than Irella had ever heard from one of the *biladiyn.* 

She winced and opened her eyes. The ground to either side of the road was greener than she remembered. Had Enduca carried her all the way into the valley? She flexed her knees experimentally. “I can walk."  

Enduca stopped walking. “You sure?” 

“Yes.” Her skin shivered and prickled, but the punishment hadn’t broken her. She got her feet under her and looked around. Alem limped beside Rimush, his hand braced on the other *biladiyn’s* shoulder. The only nomads she saw were dead, oiled braids shiny in the afternoon sun. 

Black smoke rose over the town. “Oh, no," Irella whispered. 

“Nomads broke when we charged." Rimush helped Alem past a divot in the road with rough, jerky movements. “Fired the town when they rode past. They use thatch roofs, out here.” 

Irella sucked in a breath. “We have to help.” Fire had swept through Marna once, during her novitiate. Wooden houses went up like tinderboxes; the stone houses had fared little better, cooking those trapped inside like ovens. She and her mentor, en-Jorian, had managed to build a firebreak in time to save the temple district, but not even magic could contain a city-wide conflagration once it got going. 

The only way to stop that kind of disaster was to make sure it never got out of hand in the first place. 

“We have to *get* help,” Rimush corrected. “Alem’s not going to make it to Uskune like this.” 

Irella took a closer look at Alem’s leg, bandaged with a dun-colored kerchief that one of the *biladiyn* must have carried with their kits. Blood darkened the thick cloth where blood had already soaked through. 

“Raider tried to ride us down,” Alem said in the same tone he might have used to report the weather. “Hit me with an arrow in the knee before we could get him off his mount.” 

“It split the bone,” Rimush said as he helped the senior guard navigate the last curve in the road before the township’s walls. “He’ll be lucky if he walks again.” 

Guilt pricked her. If hadn't let Wanishtu distract her, if she'd been in better shape, they could have made it to Brookside before the raiders. Instead of facing the arrows of the Monche in the open, they could have done it from behind the town's walls, where the she could have kept them safe. 

“I’ll be fine,” Alem said, but Irella had spent enough time around the Architect’s menders to know that Rimush was right. Knees were filled with finicky, fibrous tissues that were prone to all sorts of problems even before an injury—to say nothing of what might happen if the wound itself went bad. 

If Brookside had a Temple of the Architect, she could have taken Alem there, but she had been sent to build the Temple in Uskune. Brookside might see a couple of itinerate proselytizers in a season, and a handful of building crews, but it would be a stroke of luck to find one of the Gardener's menders here, now. 

If she had taken a different path, had apprenticed to a different Temple during her novitiate, perhaps she might have learned the skills to save Alem’s knee. Instead, she had learned to build towers and trenches and tree-high walls, and then she'd learned how to break them. 

If she had studied healing, perhaps she could have prevented the fever from taking her liege. She pushed the thought away as they reached the wall. Eramepi had healers, and they hadn’t saved him. 

A League courier hauled open the heavy iron gate nestled between three-storey tall guard towers. "We need a mender," Irella called to him. 

He pursed his lips. “There’s a woman who sets up in the market that the local girls go to for balms and remedies, but you don’t want your man to be walking that far through fire.” He closed the heavy bronze gates behind them and led them around to the tower entrance.

“Where is everyone?” She ducked to avoid hitting her head on the post-and-lintel door frame. “A town this size should have had enough men on the walls to fend off a squad’s worth of nomads.” 

“Farmers won’t come to trade until the next stars rise; half the houses in town are empty,” the courier said as he led them inside the guard station. After the war, it had been repurposed into a relay post.  “The rest of ‘em are just stone cowards. Useless as tits on a boar, beggin’ your pardon, nin-Irella. ‘course, they got a pretty good fire brigade, so I guess there’s that.”

Irella blinked, surprised he knew her name and at a momentary loss as to how to respond. Finally, she said, “Well, I’m glad the Monche weren’t able to breach the walls.”

“They wouldn’t have tried to burn us out if you hadn’t gotten them all riled up!” The furious voice preceded a red-faced man nose-height with Irella’s shoulder. He wore the badge of a Reeve on his stout, barrel thick chest. Soot darkened his cheeks. 

Enduca moved to put herself between Irella and the Reeve. “You think they were coming to tea?” Her tone was surprisingly conversational. 

The Reeve glared at her anyway. “They would have taken some food and left, like they’ve been doing for generations, you stupid girl.” 

“Enduca is neither *stupid* nor a *girl*. She is a *biladiyn* in the Order of the Hallowed Dakhma." Irella narrowed her eyes and stepped up beside Enduca, putting herself face to face with the Reeve. She pushed aside the pain buzzing along her skin and her worry for Alem to pull authority around her like a cloak. “You are the Reeve of this town, and responsible for the safety of its people.” 

The Reeve sniffed. “Oh, now I’m in charge? Star-cursed post-runners didn’t seem to think so when I told them they ought to get down off the wall.” 

The courier’s lips tightened, but he said nothing as he helped Alem onto a cot. 

“A wall needs people to defend it,” Irella said. “My *biladiyn* and the couriers were doing their duty, which is more than I can say for you.”  

“Yeah, well, a town needs people to defend it too, and two post-runners ain’t what the League promised us when we agreed to pay the highway tariffs, so I don’t see as how it’s my duty to piss off the Monche with Eramepi dead and the army gone. My people have been dealing with the Monche for generations, Priestess. They come, they take some food, they leave. They ain’t so different from your cursed tax collectors when you get right down to it.” 

“Raiders killed a man and burned out his farm, Reeve. Left his children without a father.” Fury at his cavalier attitude drove a spike through Irella’s naval. “This town wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for the League’s tax collectors. Do you think roads come free?” Not even the Gardener’s thaumaturges could summon food from the aether. 

The Reeve sneered at her. “The League didn’t build this road for me and mine, Priestess. Eramepi ordered it built so he could get metals from Uskune, and a dead Soveriegn’s army ain’t doing nobody any good squatting on top of a mine that hasn’t shipped any copper in a season.” 

The worst part, she realized, was that in some ways he was right. Patrollers should have stopped the raiders before they got anywhere near Brookside or its outlying farms. 

She wasn’t going to get anything useful out of arguing wtih the Reeve, though. 

“Did you come here to do anything other than complain?” she asked as politely as she could manage. 

He pulled his lips back from his teeth in a snarl of a smile. “I came to tell your rotted couriers to belay their signal flare. If an army shows up they’ll be wanting food and lodgings and it’s all a lot more trouble than they’re worth.” 

“Consider it done,” Irella said. She’d set the flares herself if it meant getting the Reeve out of the guardhouse. 

"I'll take care of it," the courier said quietly, leaving Rimush to unwrap Alem's makeshift bandages and make another attempt at cleaning the wound. 

Irella thanked him and turned back to the Reeve. “It’s handled. Now if you would please, take me to the apothecary.”  

A malicious glint lit the Reeve’s eye. “It’s on fire.” 

Irella gestured for him to precede her out the door. “Then perhaps we should go help with the buckets.” 

Shoulders stiff with suppressed fury, the Reeve led Irella and Enduca through the smoke-choked streets. Irella batted away the flecks of burning thatch that fluttered toward her, carried by the heat pulsing off the nearby buildings, until they emerged into the center square. Four buildings were shrouded in embers and flame; the bucket brigade was desperately trying to stop a fifth from catching fire. 

The brigade must have focused first on the mill; sullen steam rose from its roof but looked otherwise intact. A women stood in a patch of blue comfrey flowers as she beat at the flames clinging to the apothecary's wooden door with her shawl. Another woman had climbed one of the maidenhair saplings in the goatyard so she could toss water onto the the roof alongside two men on rope-bound ladders. 

Heat buffeted Irella like the wings of an angry swan, and she spared a moment to be grateful that Alem and Rimush were safely tucked away behind fireproof stone. 

"Hevrin!" One of the local men ran over to the Reeve. "We can't find Enilla. Kiban says she chased her cat up into the chandlery loft, but the smoke—"

Hevrin's eyes burned with dread and impotent fury as he took in the scene. "Priestess says she wants to help. Give her your bucket and come with me." 

The man shoved his bucket at Irella as Hevrin ordered the men working to supress the apothecary fire down off their ladders. "To the chandlery!" he shouted, and Irella had couldn't blame him. She squeezed the bucket's handle helplessly as everything burned. 

"I'm following you," Enduca reminded her as fiery ash continued raining down onto the hard-packed street. 

Duty told Irella to rush into the apothecary before it finished burning, find the medicines she needed to save Alem, and trust the town's Reeve to deal with the rest of the disaster. She wanted to scream that it wasn't her fault the raiders had come, that if Hevin had been brave enough to put men on the wall during the attack, they could have stood off the Monche. With enough spears and slings, and her help, they could have kept the Monche too busy to fire the town during their retreat. 

If the people of Brookside had made even the barest attempt to defend themselves, she would have been forced to pull so much of the Architect's power into the world to earn His punishment. Her skin still prickled and shivered with the aftereffects divine  retribution; she could no more use His power to save Enilla than she could have flown to Uskune on a riverboat barge. 

But Irella wasn't just a thaumaturge, and it didn't take a miracle to follow her god's mandate: build, so that cities can grow. 

"We need to flip that waterwheel around," Irella said to Enduca. "Buckets aren't much better than spit for fires like this."

Enduca gaped. "You can't possibly think that they're going let—"

—but Irella was already taking her new bucket to the toward the river;  more of a stream, really, narrow enough that Irella could have jumped over it. Irella pulled up her robes and ran after him, hoping her idea would work, that it wouldn't take too long, that the waterwheel wouldn't be too heavy, that she'd be able to find a—

There. An array of tools hung from pegs pounded into the walls, perfect for what she needed. Irella grabbed a heavy oak prybar and a mallet, then drove the prybar into the hub, locking the wheel in place. 

The duality of Nahrian gods had confused her, when Estein first brought her to Marna. Though the Gardener's Temple saw to it that the right crops were planted in the appropriate places, that herbs were dried and preserved and used properly to stave off disease, it was the Architect who claimed irrigation as part of His domain. It still made little sense to her, for none of the irrigation ditches she'd helped to dig had ever been inside a city's walls, but she was grateful now for the experience she'd gained. 

The waterwheel groaned against the prybar, but held steady. 

Water rose like a rooster's tail as the stream's flow splashed up against the frozen paddles, but Irella was already scavenging for nails and scrap boards to hammer into the sides of the waterwheel. Her hands, red and raw, slipped twice before she managed to hammer them all home, but she didn't dare take the time to rotate the wheel and do the job properly. 

"Now what?" Enduca asked, studying the wheel with raised eyebrows. 

"Ain't gonna get any water to the houses without buckets," said the boy. 

The mill race, though, was surprisingly long affair, the wooden ramp resembling nothing so much as a long trough. The mill had been added to the town after most of its buildings were placed, she guessed—not unusual when a town was allowed to grow organically, instead of being planned under the Architect's far-seeing hand. 

Poor planning worked in her favor, today. With the mallet's help, she pulled the long wooden trough free of the posts that held it in place, and lifted the end a cubit off the ground. "You see?" At Enduca's nod, she moved on to the next post and began to pry it free. "Get me help. Tell them I can redirect the stream, if they help." 

It took seven men to haul the millrace through the town and hold it up high enough to create a proper flow, but the wheel turned, and water from the stream rushed toward the chandlery. Moments later, the Reeve, clothed in a soaked suit of winter wool, emerged, his form a dark shadow in the steam and smoke the that fogged the town.. He carried a young girl cradled against his chest, her face caked with soot and tears as she wailed for her mother. 

"Thank the gods," Irella breathed, but she couldn't relax; the apothecary still burned, and without medicine, Alem risked infection or worse. 

In the chaos, Irella had to shove people into place to get them to move into place. She coughed and sputtered, holding her robes over her mouth to filter the air as she guided them men holding the millrace. Together, they repositioned the wooden sluice. Water from the river splashed over their clothes, over the street, until finally it poured onto the apothecary's house. 

The building hissed and sizzled as the river water smothered the flame, steam rising into the sky thicker than a mountain cloud. Townspeople cheered, but it wasn't enough to salvage the building. Alem needed medicine—sage or tamarind or any of the antiseptic herbs, preferably pricklecone root as well—and she hoped the fire hadn't destroyed the apothecary's gypsum plaster. 

Irella shook her head sharply. She didn't know if a town like Brookside would have plaster to bandage Alem's knee, but there was no more time to waste on speculation. The longer she waited, the more likely infection would set in. 

Irella waved away the residual smoke, and without bothering to look for the woman with the shawl, rushed toward the house. She made it three steps before Enduca grabbed her by the arm. 

"You trying to get yourself killed? Burn your arm off?" the *biladiyn* snapped. "What are you planning to do if the whole place falls down around your ears?"

"I'm not a fool, Enduca." Irella wrenched her arm free, reaching for her surveying rod as she approached the building. She pressed her robe tighter against her mouth, then prodded the door open with its hardened tip and went inside. 

Satchets and broken pots lay scattered in the dirt and ash, their contents burned and mashed beyond recognition, where they were swept by the water pouring in from the roof. 

For a long moment, Irella just stared. 

"Priestess?" It wasn't Enduca's voice. Irella turned; a wrinkled woman with maiden-braids, her hands twisted in her burned shawl, stood at her shoulder. "Thank you, Priestess. Wasn't for you, the whole place would have burned. Never woulda thought to move the millrace."

Somehow, Irella mustered up a smile despite the disappointment weighing down her gut. "You're the apothecary?" 

The woman nodded, her eyes sweeping sadly along the floor. "Gonna have a lot of burns to treat, I expect." 

Irella's smile froze; would the apothecary be willing to help Alem, if she was focused on the townspeople's burns? Could Irella blame her, for carrying more about her own community than a *biladiyn* from the capitol? "You can't do it from here," Irella said, almost before she'd finished the thought. "The relay post by the wall is far enough from the fires to be safe, and one of my guards is already there, wounded." 

Reluctance flashed across the apothecary's face. "But my garden is—" 

"Smoke in the chest is the most dangerous thing for a person, after a fire like this," Irella insisted, assuaging her guilt with the knowledge that her words were true. "We need to get people away from here until the wind blows through." 

After another moment's hesitation, the apothecary nodded. Irella and Enduca helped her gather what she needed, mostly from the washed-out garden, then led the townspeople away from the smoke and the mud and the heat and the steam. 

Outside the gatehouse, Rimush was busy hitching an ox to a cart. Irella left him to it and led the apothecary inside. As woman hurried to Alem's side, Irella took a moment to wipe her face. 

"You need to get him to a mender as quick as you can, Priestess," the apothecary said once she'd finished wrapping Alem's knee in still-damp leaves. She bound them with thin-woven linens from the relay station's bedding chest. "Not much else I can do for that knee here, but they ought to be able to help him in Marna."

Irella's heart sank; she'd been hoping for better news. She swallowed, then looked toward Alem. "Rimush can take you back to—"

Alem cut her off with one sharp shake of his head. "The army in Uskune's got menders. They can fix me up there."

Irella bit her lip, but the mulish look on his face stopped her from arguing. "Fine." She turned to the courier. "We'll need to borrow your mail cart." 

A twinge of discomfort passed over his features. "This is a relay station, nin-Irella. Protocol says..." She stared at him until he trailed off. "Of course. I'll hitch the oxen." 

Ten minutes later, the two-wheeled wooden cart was ready. Rimush claimed the driver's seat and an oxwhip by dint of some adolescent experience he hadn't been willing to detail. Alem, his leg carefully wrapped and elevated, nearly filled the narrow box behind Rimush. The shadows cast by its parchment-thin roof made him seem haggard. 

Though eager to get Alem to a mender, Irella turned to the courier and asked, "Will you be safe here?" She kept her voice low. 

He flashed her a quick, confident grin. "Reeve Hevrin's besetting sin is cowardice, Priestess. People here'll leave me well enough alone as long as I don't antagonize them too much, and I'm not so stupid." 

"Not unless there's good reason, at least?" 

He licked the tip of his finger and touched the cloth over his heart in acknowledgment of her point. "You understand." 

Enduca shook her head ruefully before handing taking up a position beside the oxcart. 

As Rimush began to lead the ox toward Uskune, Irella watched two figure crest the ridge, one tall and one small. Vira, come to join her father. Irella cursed. 

"At least they won't starve," Alem sighed. Several men hauling dead onagers passed them on their way back to town. The animals hadn't yet begun to stink; the people of Brookside would eat well while they repaired their homes. 

"They weren't in any danger of starving." Rimush's voice was cold enough that Alem shot him a dangerous look, but Irella's thin smile stopped the squad leader from interrupting. "The Gardener has—" 

"—no presence in a town like Brookside," Irella snapped. "I couldn't even convince that farmwife to go to Marna for help. That Reeve wants nothing to do with the League, even with the Monche at his gates. We did good here, Rimush, whether they realize it or not." 

"Do you think the nomads are going to keep raiding?" Enduca interrupted smoothly.

"If the garrison at Uskune keeps sitting on its hands?" Irella stared right at Rimush as she answered. "Yes."
