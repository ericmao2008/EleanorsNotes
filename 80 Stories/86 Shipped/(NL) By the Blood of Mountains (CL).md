Dear Editors & Slush Readers, 

Please consider my fantasy novelette, “By the Blood of Mountains.” I hope it suits Clarkesworld's search for unique, thought-provoking stories. 

My SFF-adjacent nonfiction articles were published on Tor.com. I am passionate about telling well-researched stories in underrepresented settings. 

Thank you for your consideration, 

Eleanor Konik
