Dear Editors, 

I hope you enjoy my 750 word food-themed science fiction flash piece, “Can Androids Cope with Tiny Goats?” 

I've had nonfiction published with Tor.com and SFWA, and I run a freemium newsletter where I share weekly research and (very) short fiction over at https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com 

Thank you for your consideration, 

Eleanor Konik
