Kala leaned backward, curling into herself as Tusiata's cloud-gray wings flared with the force of his frustration. He'd helped her clear the morning ice and snow from the leather of her tent, his duty as one of the bachelor males fostered into her clan, but she wished he hadn’t stuck around.

"I don't see why I can't go with you," he whined.

The leather-dark confines of her maiden-tent were thrice as big as her space in her father's yurt, but today it felt crowded and stifling as she hurried to pack for her first solo solstice dig.

She didn't know how to make him leave without offending him. "The Realmwalker needs me to gather the bluestone from the Cairns and purify it into aetherals. That's not something you can do for me, Tusiata. It takes a priestess of the first blood."

Since her mother died half a season ago, Kala was the only trained priestess in Kukihoi clan. 

"I'm not trying to do it for you." He was clearly striving for a reasonable tone. "I just want to keep you company, in case something goes wrong. It's the first time you're going to the Cairns alone."

The Cairns were sacred, the holy rock garden where the Realmwalker's presence remained strong in the world He'd brought them to generations ago. She'd buried the boiled broth of her mother's body in the Cairns during the Ritual of Mourning, the remains of her presence in this world mingling with their god's lingering touch. Even if the idea of letting a bachelor male witness sacred rites didn't feel like sacrilege, she wouldn't have wanted witnesses to her grief when she returned. 

He was trying to be nice, though, so she kept her voice as gentle and regretful as she could. Tusiata was one of her two choices for a husband, and if she angered him now, it would lead to a miserable marriage. Her parents had taught her that over and over again. "Mama always insisted that some things are for a priestess to do alone."

"You're the senior priestess now, Kala. It's _your_ decision. I could go with you halfway and then—"

She didn't want to think about the implications of no longer having her mother as a buffer.

The tent flap opened, letting ice-cold wind sweep in to bite her thinly-veiled skin. The winds must have shifted. "Stop embarrassing yourself, Tusiata," Mahiai said cheerfully, pushing back the heavy hood of his woolen parka. There was no denying her second choice of husbands was handsome, every barb of his crownfeathers carefully plaited into an intricate braid. Even the crystalline paleness of his cheeks were unblemished save for the marble pattern of indigo veins that marked them all as the Realmwalker's refugees. "She won't budge. I already tried."

The self-deprecating tone was pitch-perfect humor, but Tusiata still rubbed his wings together self-consciously. Kala almost followed suit; Mahiai’s every word, every gesture, breathed polish too perfect to trust. 

"Why are you here?" Kala hid her expression in the task of binding her waterskin to her torso, where her body could keep the liquid warm enough to drink. 

"The winds are shifting. It's going to be a trade year. Your father sent me to let you know that we're heading south to the Trade Temple as soon as you're finished with the solstice rituals."

Tusiata's face, bare in the warmth of her tent, tightened with urgency. "Kala, you need to decide which one of us you're going to marry." 

The trade winds would send the priests south from the Tower to trade with the southern mountain people in one of the rare windows where it was cold enough to do so. The annual festival would be moved up so the priests could be present for the necessary annual ceremonies—like fosterage and marriage. 

Kala didn't want to marry either of them. Nothing she'd seen of marriage made her want it for herself, and she hadn't known Tusiata and Mahiai long enough for either to change her mind. "I need to gather bluestone first." Kala shoved the last of her tools into her travel bag and knotted it without looking. 

"You should let us go with you," Mahiai said. "Tusiata is right. We can help, and if you don't decide soon, the priests will decide for you." Mahiai didn't sound too worried, and no wonder. His great-uncle Rukanui served the Tower as High Priest, and his mother was the senior priestess of Hanaupo clan. He was the obvious choice to succeed her father as clan leader. If she chose to marry Tusiata instead, Mahiai would have an easy path to become High Priest in his great-uncle's footsteps. 

Life had given him every advantage, and if it wasn't fair to hate him for it, at least Tusiata sometimes seemed like he cared about her for her own sake, and not the prestige wedding her would bring. 

Rather than dwell on it anymore, Kala donned her heavy parka and shouldered her pack as quickly as she could. "Fine. You can both come."

Without waiting for a response, she launched herself into the air with a leap and a powerful flap of her speckled wings. 

* * * 

Though she had inherited her mother’s cauldron only half a season ago, Kala had gotten used to the its weight resting thimble-small against her neck. Now that it sat enlarged by the mystical properties of the Realmwalker’s blessing, she felt strangely naked, even accounting for the fact that it emanated enough heat for her to to shed her parka outdoors. 

Filled with thin flakes of bluestone she’d carefully scraped from the Cairns, the cauldron burned hotter than any mortal flame, but without smoke or fire. Yet if she touched it, it would not burn her flesh. 

"It’s been a long time since we’ve had a trade year.” Kala’s cousin Healani, freshly appointed the clan’s junior priestess since Kala had no daughter yet, spun her whalebone spindle in the warmth and otherwise paid little attention to the sacred rite. “Wind’s blowing backwards down by the pines, feels weird trying to fly the wrong way.”

"The bluestone’s boiling,” Kala said, trying to force the older girl to focus. 

"I know,” Healani said. “But if you don’t pick which one of those boys you want to marry, the priests will pick for you.” 

Dodging the familiar refrain, Kala gave her oiled paddle—carved from precious lowland pine—to Healani. “Put it in the cauldron and stir. Watch it doesn’t bubble up and burn off your feathers.” 

Healani laughed and obeyed. “I can talk and stir at the same time. You can too, Kala. Come on. It’ll help to talk through it.” 

Refining aetherals for the Realmwalker was a sacred duty. Mining and melting down raw bluestone into aetheral crystals big enough to carve into idols was hot, delicate work, but Healani was right. She could work and talk at the same time. She just didn’t want to.

"It’s not fair,” Kala said finally. “I don’t really want to get married at all. At least not now.” 

"Winds don’t care about fair,” Healani chided, which was easy for her to say—she’d chosen a husband last season. She looked forward to marrying Oeakoa, a big bull of a man with wings as fast as starfall and eyes that thought Healani wove the sky. She hadn’t hardly needed to *choose,* it had been so obvious they were right for each other. Besides, Healani didn’t hold the future of the clan her shoulders. 

Whoever married Kala would lead Kukihoi clan when her father died, and whichever of her potential lovers she rejected would be sent to the Tower for initiation into the priesthood, where they would spend the rest of their days farming, patrolling, hunting, and waiting for festival-time to ever see a woman. 

"Tusiata is so sweet,” Kala said. “He really cares about me, I’m sure of it.” 

"Skilled with his hands, you said.” Healani winked. 

"And the herds!” Kala said, laughing as she fetched another block of tulpi fat to melt beside the cauldron. “He’s strong. But Mahiai is fast, and clever. I think people like him more.” 

"He’d be a good clan leader,” Healani said cheerfully as she stirred the cauldron. 

Kala bit her lip in frustration, quick and hard enough she nipped her tongue in the process. She swallowed the blood, the cold blue of shame flushing her ice-pale cheeks. 

"You okay?” Healani asked. 

Kala nodded silently, unwilling to break the taboos against letting others see her blood. Eheuian blood was sacred, hers as a priestess more so; the Realmwalker’s proscriptions against public bleeding were clear. 

"Look, I’m sorry you don’t have any perfect choices. But at least you have a choice, they don’t. Go easy on them, okay?” 

Kala looked down, then flinched when she saw the inside of the cauldron. It was half as full as it should have been. Even if Healani had let it boil over—she hadn’t, Kala had been here the whole time—there should have been plenty of raw aetheral to work with. 

Healani noticed the direction of her her gaze, the change in her demeanor, and froze. "What’s wrong?”

"I think we need more bluestone,” Kala said. 

* * * 

After two more trips to the Cairn, even when Kala did _everything_ herself, the cauldron still wasn’t full. 

"This isn’t enough,” her father said when she presented him with six idols at sundown. Caipan’s blue eyes blazed from within the black leather mask of the clan chief. 

Kala stiffened her wings, manufacturing confidence to hide the worry in her heart. “This is all there is.” 

Caipan shook his head once, a long gesture of negation. “Unacceptable. We have promises to keep, Kala. You must make at least four more.” 

Kala pulled back slightly in surprise; ten idols of aetheral was far more than she and her mother had ever created together. Each idol was shaped by hand, then left in the snow to cool in the shape of one of the Realmwalker’s sacred symbols; the tulpi horn, the Eheuian wing, the pine bough. 

Her mother would have pushed back on the demand, she was sure. A clan chief should not be dictating sacred matters to the clan’s priestess. Still, he was her father. She was unmarried and untried as a priestess. She looked at the ground, ashamed of her failure and of her cowardice. “I’m sorry, father. If I harvest any more, there won’t be any for next year.” She’d already taken twice as much raw bluestone as she ever had before; she’d stopped only when the stone beneath the surface was so pale she could hardly detect a hue. 

"Don’t give me such nonsense. Your mother—” 

"My mother is dead,” Kala reminded him sharply. She couldn’t bear to hear her mother criticized, or worse, be compared to the memory. It wasn’t her fault Kirina had died young, gored by a tulpi before she could finish Kala’s training as a priestess. 

"If you had helped her instead of swooning around in indecision over who to marry, maybe she wouldn’t have wasted her lifeblood!” 

Kala stared at him as she tried to parse the sentence. “What do you mean?” she asked finally. 

"Did she teach you nothing?” the disgust in his voice stabbed her like an augury-spear. Her mother had taught her *so* much, so much her father would *never* know—he was a man, married with children. He wasn’t even initiated into the mysteries of the Tower. 

"What was she supposed to have taught me?” Kala asked. 

With no warning and none of the gentleness a man should show his child, he yanked her glove off and sliced his sharp copper knife across her bared palm. Blue blood welled up and slid into her hand before she had finished hissing from the pain. Kala stared at it, fascinating and revolted by the sight of her blue-stained skin, which had already begun to prickle from the cold. 

"What have you done?” she whispered. 

"Hold the idol,” her father ordered, shoving the crystalline tulpi horn into her hands. Since he was still holding that knife—since her mother was dead, and she was afraid—Kala obeyed, grasping the horn with her bloody hand. 

The idol took on a fiery glow, pulsing slightly as it seemed to absorb the viscous blue liquid, which had already begun to clot and freeze in the alpine air. Within seconds, the idol grew a third again the size, overflowing the careful lines she had carved until it was nothing more than a misshapen lump, like a mallow puff heated too quickly in a shallow pan. 

"This is sacrilege,” Kala whispered. With mounting horror, she realized her own mother had bled for the cauldron, despite the proscriptions against exposed blood and the dangers of open wounds in the frozen Eheu air. She must have bled too much, and her father must have hidden it, and—

Her stomach roiled with nausea. Her own father must have sacrificed one of the clan's prize bulls to cover up the truth of her mother's death. 

But why? Why violate the precepts of the Realmwalker to create sacred gifts for the Realmwalker? 

“Your mother died for this.” Caipan’s wings snapped out in fury. “Don’t you dare let her sacrifice be for nothing, girl.” 

Kala fought back bile. “Ten idols,” she said. “Before we leave for the trade meet.” 

Caipan nodded sharply. “Go.” 

* * * 

That night, with all six points of the Great Bow bright in the starlit sky, Kala crept out of her maiden-tent and flew north over Eheu Island. Her wings held her aloft despite the stinging ache in her arms and the dizziness that crowded her thoughts. Her father had insisted on watching as she melted down the idols she had so painstakingly carved and dutifully bled into the cauldron, but he slept now, and had posted no watch on her movements. 

Doubtless he thought her too weak to flee, and maybe he was right. 

By rights, she should have fallen to the ground, weighed down by the anchor in her heart and the leaden feeling in her belly, but in defiance of all sane natural laws her wings supported her weight and she stayed aloft until she reached the edge of the crater at the center of the Isle. Perhaps the Realmwalker’s blessings aided her flight—more likely, after she had so blatantly violated His precepts, the ache in her wings was penance. 

If she died here, just collapsed into the bare snow at the edge of the god-touched valley of the Tower, her father would be forced to petition to bring her brother Ereni back to the clan; his wife was a junior priestess in the Pakai clan and the best choice to train Healani. Would Ereni fight their father if he tried to bleed Amalai? If he won, he would be clan chief, but leadership passed through the female line. If Amalai became senior priestess of Kukihoi, when Amalai’s mother died the clans would merge. Kukihoi would cease to be; Caipan’s legacy, her mother’s legacy, her grandfather’s legacy, all their stories would fade to nothing more than dry-solstice smoke. 

Bubbles of fury capped the wave of anguish and sorrow that rolled over her. 

She wasn’t going to die here. She was going to report her father’s sacrilege to the Temple, and find answers. If that meant promising to marry Mahiai so that High Priest Rukanui was motivated to help her, so be it. 

On ill-trained feet, Kala hiked her way to the Tower that had been her people’s first home on Eheu Isle, when the Realmwalker carried them here in the blue-violet bubble of His embrace. The air warmed as she walked deeper into the valley, still freezing but not so cold to stop the roots of the scraggly, pollen-choked pines that fed the tulpi her people relied on to survive the inhospitable land the Realmwalker brought them to nearly two hundred years ago. 

He forged the Tower from the bones of the world, a place of safety and rest for His people, a needle of the same gray metal as the irreplaceable cauldrons He had gifted her ancestors. It strove toward the sky, taller than any building they could construct through mundane means, a place where her ancestors had lived and worshiped until they outgrew the single building and spread to populate the Isle, returning at festival time with symbols of their devotion. 

There had to be more to it than that. Else her father wouldn’t have insisted on such a specific number. Ten idols. Why? Her mother never said what the idols were for, other than to represent the clan’s continuing adulation of the Realmwalker, so that when He returned, He would know He was loved. She’d never heard any other reason from her friends in other clans, seen only at festival times. 

She planned to ask the priests, but when she reached the shadow of the Tower, she saw no one. 

Kala stared at the building with exhausted eyes. She hadn’t expected _everyone_ to have gone south to the Trade Temple. When Kukihoi clan left their territory, they left behind the ill and the infirm, the too pregnant to travel and the too old to fly so far. 

The Realmwalker's voice whispered warnings as she approached. 

"...you must not burn the wood of the cliffside pine, for it is too precious... "

Wings fluttering with nerves and exhaustion, she walked inside. 

The polished slate shelves that should have housed hundreds of aetherals, one for every settlement for every festival going back to the days of the founding itself, were empty. It should have been impossible. Everyone on the island knew the Laws. The Realmwalker had seen to that when he built the Tower, engraving each word into the stone itself. 

Every year at the typhoon equinox the words were announced by the walls, booming, audible everywhere on the Isle. If every man, woman and child of Eheu Isle had been illiterate, they would have known their duty. Even now, they whispered to her. 

"...to bleed before others is anathema, for the unlike will not tolerate the unlike, and My people must above all survive until My return..." 

But the whispers gave her a thought: maybe the Realmwalker had come back? Maybe He had taken the offering and been pleased. Maybe He was responsible for the impurity of the crystals she had tried to refine, maybe all was as he would expect and nothing ill would come of—

Her mother was dead.

If the Realmwalker had returned, why would the priests have kept it a secret? Why would her father worry over 'promises to keep' instead of celebrating a promise kept? When the Realmwalker had brought her people to Eheu, it had broken the world itself, driving the mountains of the Isle so far into the sky that only they could live in its heights, they and their faithful tulpi herds. 

No, this had to be new. But how could the priests not have kno—

Either her parents had decided on their own that they needed to offer ten idols to the Realmwalker this season, her father had an agreement with another clan whose priestess was failing and didn’t want it known, or _the priests themselves had demanded more idols._ 

But why? Why were they gone? 

Kala gritted her teeth. She still had time to return home. If she flew all night, no one would be the wiser about her absence, or the missing idols. She could marry Mahiai, and—and what? Keep bleeding for the cauldron until she made a bad cut, and died young like her mother? And condemn Tusiata to a life in a priesthood that had failed in their most important duty? 

No. She needed answers. 

With her mother dead there was only one person she could think to ask. Kala took a deep breath of the crater’s cool, wet air and launched exhausted body back into the sky. 

* * * 

The Pakai were an inland clan; their range wasn't far from the Tower. Since Ereni's wife, Amalai, was pregnant, they were still at the base camp and easy to find. The hearth fires were still being built up when Kala landed in the base camp of her oldest brother's marriage-clan.  

As a guest, she was greeted warmly. As close kin, she was given precedence at a breakfast she badly needed, but it wasn't until the afternoon that she was able to speak with Amalai alone. 

By then, she was so exhausted she could barely keep her wings from dragging on the ground as she explained to Amalai what had brought her so far east. 

Amalai pressed a delicate hand against her bulbous belly. "There aren’t any idols in the Tower?"

"I thought the priests might help me stand against father, but if the idols are missing… they have to know," Kala said, trying to keep the distress from her voice. Kala outranked her as a full priestess, since Amalai's mother still held the Pakai clan cauldron, but Amalai was a woman grown, half a decade older, with two children and another coming. Kala couldn't afford to be dismissed as a hysterical child. 

"Let me see your hand again," Amalai said. 

Kala pulled back her sleeve and showed her brother's wife the angry violet scab that had formed on her forearm. 

Amalai blew out a long breath. "Mother's been asking me to find more and more bluestone, even though I'm pregnant. I thought it was because she wants to make sure my daughters both have a chance to learn, but... there must be more to it, if your own father *bled* you." 

Kala was too exhausted to hold back tears at the shame of it. Amalai wrapped her arms around Kala as she sobbed. “I’m sorry,” Kala blubbered. “I know you’re pregnant. I just didn’t know where else to turn!” 

“It’s alright,” Amalai said, patting the back of her head like a child. “You’ll get some rest, Ereni and I will pack, and then we’ll go to the Trade Temple and find out what’s going on.” 

* * * 

Kala’s brother Ereni, faced with the choice of accompanying his pregnant wife or staying back at camp with his young children, left the girls in the care of an aunt and came along. Kala feared he would never forgive her; his heavy brows furrowed with every strained breath Amalai took. Was that what love looked like, for a priestess? Tusiata, she knew, would have been just as angry if she’d been forced to risk herself while gravid with child. 

Kala suspected that only the scar forming beneath her gloves kept her brother from dragging his wife back home, but despite Kala’s wingstrain and the extra weight Amalai carried, they finally made it to the ancient site of the trade meet. A century ago, the priesthood had built a huge temple of cut pine overlooking the edge of the world, and from there they launched their expeditions. The clan camps fanned out like rays of sun around that central point, the more prestigious members pitching their tents closest to the ridge, where they could see the sea.

Young men filled the surrounding sky, flexing their muscles and stretching their wings in the heavy salt air, doing their best to impress the clan leaders enough to inspire a fosterage that might lead to marriage. A place in the priesthood came with its own prestige—better food and a chance to call the island's only valley land home—but by the time they were old enough for the choice, most boys wanted a woman more than they wanted easy access to euphorigum.

"I forgot how much warmer it is here," Kala shouted, fighting the thick air.

The air by the beach would be stifling, hot and wet — breathing it at any other time of year would lead to nothing but a salty death.

"Better food, though," Amalai shouted back with a wan attempt at a smile. 

They hadn't hadn't eaten anything but pemmican since they'd started flying south; for three days, Amalai fought to keep it down. Kala's stomach clenched and snarled hungrily at the thought of a hot meat stew. She could see animals down along the beach, specks she knew to be goats and penguin. One big blob must even be a beached whale carcass. With the trade winds blowing, it would soon be cool enough at the beach at night for a team of priests to go down and harvest the bones. Maybe Healani would be able to trade for a new spindle.

The air became increasingly stifling as they landed, and Kala shrugged out of her heavy parka as soon as they reached the area designated claimed by her brother's clan. Amalai, pregnant and heavy with it, struggled to breathe the thick coastal air, but she refused to stop until they'd found her mother's tent. Jorali was a priestess; it was easy to find, a stone's throw from the cliff edge beside a patch of greenberries and coppiced chestnut that had been carefully tended for generations.

If it weren't for the heavy air, the lack of pine pollen for their herds of tulpi, and the narrowness of the space, it might have been an idyllic place for a settlement. But even the priests could not bear the lowlands long enough to maintain the Temple when the Trade Winds weren't blowing the cold peak winds into the Temple to make the hot, heavy air bearable for Eheuan lungs.

"Amalai, a woman in your condition has no business—" The old priestess cut herself off as soon as she saw Kala. "Girl, your father said you were dead. What trouble are you bringing on my daughter's head?"

Amalai spoke before Kala could formulate an answer. “The priests losing every idol in the Tower isn’t Kala’s fault, Mama.” 

Jorali’s wing-jerk of surprise was sharp enough to slice steak. Then, she narrowed her eyes at Kala. "And how might you know that, girl? Tower's closed 'til festival time."

Kala shifted her wings in an unconscious attempt to settle her nerves. "I was hoping to find guidance about what to do about my father," she said, choosing a humble tack over the outrage she wished she was brave enough to express.

"Your father." Jorali's voice was flat and unsympathetic, but at least she didn't sound angry. "And what prompted you to seek guidance?"

Kala's stomach clenched. Jorali didn't see her as a priestess: she was acting like Kala was a rebellious child, a runaway, a brat determined to fight against a parent's righteous authority. It was there in her voice, in the disapproving cant to the corners of her eyes.

Shoulders curled in toward her chest in an attempt to signal submission, Kala extended her hand. The angry scab did a poor job of showing the depth of her wound, but it was the best evidence she had. "He wasn't happy with the number of idols Healani and I were able to make during the solstice ritual. He said that since my mother died using her lifeblood I had to make up for my failures," she choked a little on the word, "it was my duty to bleed on the aetherals to make them grow, because there were promises we had to keep."

"Your failures?" Jorali asked sharply.

"I don't know!" Kala said, and to her horror, burst into tears. Through her sobs, she managed, "I don't know who to marry, she sent me to spend time with them, we're running out of time, I didn't know it would kill her!"

Amalai's arms came around her shoulders. Kala closed her eyes and took three deep breaths, the salty sea air foreign and disorienting to her nose.

"Your mother was a skilled priestess, Kala," Jorali said with a sigh. "No amount of canoodling on your part can possibly be responsible for her death.”

Kala blinked at the abrupt change in tone. 

Jorali pursed her lips as her eyes skittered to her daughter. Reluctantly, she said, "It is known that, in times of emergency, we can sacrifice to cause a greater amount of aetheral to form. It was such a sacrifice that brought our people to this world." Her tone turned testy. "Realmwawlking requires a great deal of power, even for a god. It is our duty to refine the bluestone in the sacred spaces so that when He visits, He is not trapped here, unable to do His work protecting us from our enemies in the Realms we fled."

Kala considered the implications with mounting horror. "Bluestone comes from the bodies of our dead," she said slowly.

"You'd prefer we sacrifice the living to the Realmwalker?" Jorali snapped.

"Like my mother?" Kala shot back.

"If someone had sacrificed your mother to make aetheral, your father wouldn't have bothered to bleed your hand," Jorali said grimly. “He would have had plenty to work with if he knew how to process it.” 

Kala swallowed. "He protects us, and we serve him proudly," Kala managed. Once she got past her instinctive aversion, it almost seemed like a fair trade. Was this why the rituals of the priestesses were kept secret? What else had her mother failed to pass on? "We have promises to keep, like father said. But how can the Realmwalker protect us from our enemies if we have no idols to give him when he returns? If our priestesses are dying to make aetheral before they pass on their knowledge?"

Jorali didn't look worried.  "I'll worry about that once I'm sure they're actually missing."

Kala bit her lip, hard, to control her spike of frustration. Jorali was a senior priestess following a logical chain of thought. Maybe she was right, and the idols had just been moved.

From their sacred space, where they had been entombed for generations.

The blood and bones of her people, boiled and dried to fuel the travels of an absent god, and now stolen.

"So you'll inquire?" Kala asked.

Jorali laughed, the sound high and tinged with either mockery or hysteria—Kala wasn't sure, and her uncertainty made her uncomfortable. "No," Jorali said. "But I'll make sure High Priest Rukanui answers you before he sends you back to your father."

"What? But he—"

"He showed you your duty," Jorali said firmly. "That it never should have been your duty is hardly the chief's fault."

Kala turned her gaze politely toward the ground. She knew an argument she couldn't win when she saw one. "Yes, senior."

* * * 

Jorali arranged a meeting with High Priest Rukanui, scheduled for constellation-peak. Kala had no intention of showing up without proof or leverage, so she begged off from Jorali's supervision with the excuse that she needed to check in with her father and the rest of Kukihoi clan.

As soon as she was out of Jorali’s view, she turned toward the afternoon sun in search of Healani, hoping she would be visiting her lover’s clan instead of with the clan chief—if Caipan was telling everyone his daughter was dead, he would need to find a way to make Healani the senior priestess, but without the cauldron… 

Kala shook her head. She wasn’t dead, the cauldron wasn’t missing, and her father was the least of her worries if even a senior priestess like Jorali thought that bleeding into a cauldron of bluestone to overproduce aetheral for idols that weren’t even being stored in the Tower anymore was her duty. 

Her duty was to the Realmwalker—not her father, not the High Priest. 

“Kala!” 

It was Tusiata. Half-drunk on euphorigum, by the looks of him; his dark crownfeathers were unbound and uncombed. Tusiata took her shoulders in his bare, calloused hands and clasped her to his chest like he thought she might vanish. "You disappeared! We thought you were dead."

"What happened?" Mahiai—they must have been together. "Don't tell us it's secret priestess stuff. Not when we're about to get hauled off to the Tower because you weren't here to make a decision about which one of us to marry."

"You think I ran into the wilderness in the middle of a trade wind shift because I couldn't handle making choices?" Kala stared Mahiai from the comfort of Tusiata’s arms. "My mother is dead, my father lied to the whole clan about why she’s dead, I can't find a single one of the idols the priests are supposed to be protecting, even though that’s supposed to be what the priesthood is for—and if I don't find proof that the priesthood is committing worse sacrilege than my own father forced me into, I'll be lucky if they don't take my cauldron and strip me of childbearing rights." She broke off, breathing heavily.

Tusiata recoiled, though he didn’t release his grip on her arms.  Mahiai just blinked.

"How can we help?" Tusiata said, and in that moment Kala nearly wept with relief. 

She took a breath to get herself back under control. "Are either of you friends with any of the priests on guard duty for the Temple?"

"You're asking one of us to betray our future comrades. At least one of us is going to end up serving the priests." He always sounded so reasonable. She wanted to shake him. 

"I'm asking you to help me find out how the Realmwalker has been betrayed!" Kala hissed. "Surely no loyal priest of the Tower would begrudge that!"

Mahiai narrowed his eyes, a little light of anger at the corners. "Will you choose, or will you keep asking us to do things for you because you know we don't dare deny you?"

“She doesn’t deserve that,” Tusiata said. 

“Of course she does,” Mahiai snorted. “She has complete control over our lives.” 

"No!" Kala hissed, hoping no one had heard his outburst—or that if they had, they would ignore it as a lover's spat. "I don't! I don't even have control over my own life. I’ve spent my whole life doing what I was told. I trusted my parents and the senior priestesses and your uncle, but it turns out they’re all betraying the Realmwalker and my mother _died_ committing _sacrilege_ on my father’s orders and the priests know and the only thing you care about is which one of you gets to join which group of sinners?” 

“What if she said she wasn’t going to marry either of us,” Tusiata said to Mahiai. “What would you do then?” 

Had he been talking to Healani? 

“Talk to my mother, I guess,” Mahiai said, looking uncertain for the first time. “She’s a priestess too.” 

Kala clutched the small cauldron at her throat and fought to think. The priests didn't yet know that Kala knew about the missing idols. She didn't have long until Jorali spoke with Rukanui and she would lose her chance to investigate their camp. This might be her only chance to find out what was going on.

“You can’t,” Kala said. “Mahiai, what if she’s a part of it? We have to find out. Help me find proof.” 

Mahiai sighed, then nodded. “Kirken has guard duty tonight.” 

“Will you talk to him?” 

Mahiai hesitated. “He likes Tusiata more than he likes me.” 

"Pull the other one," Tusiata said with a strained attempt at humor. "Everybody likes you."

"Listen," Mahiai said, his voice low. "Kirken's wings are smaller than they ought to be. He has trouble flying. He's brilliant and he's great at finding pine cone nuts and he's quick on his feet, but when it came time for the foster-trades, nobody wanted him. It's not my fault, but I was the first one from Hanaupo clan to get fostered out, and he's got a lot of resentment in him for that."

"Fine." Tusiata sighed. "I'll talk to him."

* * * 

There was no hint of Tusiata's turmoil when he approached his friend at the edge of the priest camp. A quarter of the size of any of the clan camps, it had thrice the number of armed, able-bodied men. If the Realmwalker returned to Eheu Isle and needed an army, he was supposed to have one in the form of the priesthood.

The idols were supposed to be his armory. 

"Hey, Kirken. I think I'm going to wind up pledging to the Tower," Tusiata said in the distance. "What's it like, really? The rumors can't all be true, can they?"

"Well, which rumors have you heard?" Kala could just barely hear Kirken's response.

"Are you sure you want me to come along for this?" Mahiai asked in a low voice. "I could go back to camp and talk to your father. I don't need any more proof than your hand and your word that he hurt you. You're the clan's priestess now; if you marry me, I can challenge him for control of the clan."

It was the first time they'd had to be alone. Of course he was still trying to convince her to marry him. Kala wanted to scream.

"This is bigger than the clan," Kala said tightly. If the priesthood had been corrupted, if even a small group of priests had forsaken their vows, if the rot stretched beyond her mother's foolishness and her father's fear, then it could devastate their entire species.

"As clan leader, I would have the right to demand—"

"Nothing more than is my right to demand as a priestess," Kala reminded him. "It's not a question of rights. It's a question of conviction."

Comprehension relaxed Mahiai's features. "You want me with you so I can convince people that whatever we find was really there."

"Yes," Kala said shortly. In the eyes of most, Kala was just a girl who had lost her mother and defied her father. Not even Jorali had really believed her — she needed proof, and witnesses. Mahiai, however she felt about him, was well-regarded, well-connected, and widely considered the wisest and most honorable of his age-group.

No one thought him besotted with her, like Tusiata. No, he was ambitious, and everyone knew it. No one would believe he would demean himself and the clan by lying simply to support Kala. Not when he had the potential to become the next High Priest if she chose Tusiata as her partner.

"Alright, then," Mahiai said with a rakish grin. "Let's go see if they brought the idols here."

With the guard's attention away from them, Kala and Mahiai needed nothing more than careful feet and their darkest layer of clothing to sneak into the Temple through the side door. The big building was was mostly empty; the majority of the priests were overseeing the celebrations in the chestnut grove. Kala could hear the dull roar of a bonfire, an indulgence they would never risk on the ice.

She should be there, leading her clan in song, drinking greenberry juice and eating thick tuber soup, not sneaking around the Trade Temple.

For such a big building, it felt surprisingly hollow on the inside. Most of the floor was covered in bedrolls, with a handful of carved bones stacked on narrow shelves. The corridors were filled with trade goods; dried greens, painted tulpi skins, carved bone. Otherwise, the Temple had no adornments, no decorations; there was nothing impractical to be seen. No touches of warmth, no toys, not even games.

Tusiata could never be happy here. Was that reason enough to marry him? 

"Maybe there's nothing here," Mahiai whispered after they'd finished searching the second tower for any signs of the idols. They would have been impossible to miss; even if they had crushed them into pure aetheral powder to save room—a thought that made her heart clench—the wall of idols from the Tower could have held enough to fill a wagon.

"Let's keep looking," Kala said.

The next turret was more ostentatious. Fur cloaks adorned with carefully knotted fringe hung from hooks on the walls. Ceramic jugs painted with exquisite skill sat on low tables. Kala's heart beat faster when she noticed a pile of lumpy tulpi-stomach bags across the room.

Before she could investigate, hard-booted footsteps echoed through the wooden building. Grateful for the noise-dampening effect of her soft moccasins, Kala ducked behind one of the fancy cloaks.

Mahiai, closer to the door they'd come in, slipped back out into the norther corridor, his expression clearly conflicted between self-preservation and the desire to rush to her side. It warmed her briefly, but she had more important things to dwell on.

Blinded by the thick furs, she traced the priests' progress across the room by their heavy grunts and muttered complaints. She hoped they were just fetching more euphorigum for the festival, but when the sound of receded, she looked out and the sacks were gone.

As quickly as she dared, Kala followed the two priests until they left the Temple. Through the age-smooth wooden doors, she listened to them greet Kirken.

"Where are you going?" Tusiata asked curiously. Kala's heart swelled with gratitude, tightening her throat uncomfortably.

"Getting a head start on loading the seasail ships," answered one of the priests.

"Why are you here instead of at the festival?" the other asked, disapproval rippling through the words.

Mahiai slid beside her by the door. "We have to get out of here." He barely breathed the words.

"He was keeping me company," Kirken said defensively.

"No company on guard duty. Keep sharp." The volume and pitch of his voice changed slightly. "Back to your clan, youngling. You can talk to Kirken after you initiate."

Kala nodded and pointed back the way they came. Quietly, they made their escape. When Kala turned toward the seasail dock, Mahiai grabbed her arm.

“Where are you going? We need to wait for Tusiata.”

“He’s probably headed back to the festival. We can meet up with him later,” Kala said. It wasn’t like he’d actually gotten in trouble. “Come on, I don’t want to miss our chance to find out where they put those bags. ”

He didn’t let go. "We almost got caught, Kala, and we can’t afford to go up against the whole priesthood. Do you remember what happened when the Jorjia clan leader tried to refuse to send her son to the priesthood after his lover died and he had no one to marry?"

Kala winced. She remembered the story, although it had been decades ago. The priests had refused all trade with the clan until the boy was sent—no whalebone, no southern silk, no wood, no greenberry juice. His sister nearly died of the bloody gums before his father let him go.

Mahiai obviously intended it as a reminder of the power that the priesthood held. Kala wondered if it was power they deserved, anymore. “I’m going,” she said. “With or without you.”

He threw up his hands. “Kala, this isn’t worth the risk. What if the sacks were filled with dried greenberries, or something else innocuous? Let’s go back to camp and try to find your father.”

“I saw them move those sacks in the middle of the evening; what else could it have been but the idols? Nothing else makes sense. I just need proof,” Kala insisted. “Something they can’t twist or deny.”

“Come on, Kala. If they are, how can the High Priest not know? They emptied the Tower you said. Even your parents knew. What are you going to do about it if they are selling the idols for some reason.”

Kala hesitated for a long moment, then thought of Jorali. Mahiai was the beloved son of a powerful clan. Handsome, charismatic, convincing. He didn’t understand what it was like to have everyone around him not trust what he said. “I’ll figure it out when I’m sure,” Kala said, and slipped off to follow the priests.

* * * 

The priests were done by the time she snuck onto the saildock pier jutting south from the cliff edge. She found the bags mere feet from the High Priest’s tradeship, tied to the bowpost where they wouldn’t blow off onto the beach below.  Kala laid down and stretched to reach them, feeling the contours of the contents; the tulpi horn, the pine bow. 

Before she could untie the knots, a silk-gloved hand gripped her wrist, hard enough to bruise. “This is a sacred space.” The priest’s face was veiled behind a tulpi-feather mask, but the tension in his wings made his fury clear. 

His fury matched her own. “Not so sacred that the Realmwalker’s idols belong here!”

"What the Tower does with—" he moved so fast, priest-fast, reflexes honed by years of exercise and wargames, that Kala barely managed to flinch. In seconds she was gagged, hands and wings bound in his cloak, and dragged through the air to the Temple of Trade, where the High Priest waited. 

He met her in front of the fire in the Temple’s central courtyard. Though small, the open fire—fueled by wood, not carefully rendered lamp oil—would have been an almost unimaginable luxury at any other time and place. If the flickering red flames were meant to intimidate her, they succeeded. 

Her father and Jorali were already there. 

Kala met Jorali's pitying gaze with a twitch of shame. "You should have waited for the meeting," the older woman said as she removed Kala’s gag. 

"They brought the idols _here_," Kala said. “I saw them. They’re going to sell them!” 

"You'd prefer they rot in an abandoned tower?" Rukanui said, and Kala nearly gasped. "I admire your piety, girl, I really do, but the southern traders will pay more for aetheral than the Realmwalker ever has. I'm not inclined to let our people suffer in deprivation in the futile hope that a god who brought us here and abandoned us on an icy rock might one day return.”

Kala, wings bound and flanked by unsympathetic elders, seethed with fury. “How much?”

Rukanui’s eyes, the only part of his face visible behind his feathered mask, twitched with satisfaction that made Kala’s stomach turn. “Medicine, for one. Have you noticed the tulpi herds are growing larger? Silk gloves, for fine work.”

“We’ve always been able to trade for those things,” Kala said stubbornly. 

“You don’t understand, girl. You’re too young to know what privation really is.” He shook his head. “It doesn’t matter. Here's how it's going to be. Are you listening?"

She clenched her fists, and felt the pain of her half-healed injury. “I’m listening.” 

“You’re going to go back with your father. You’re going to marry Mahiai, because he’s a sensible young man.” 

Kala nodded obediently to the first order she’d ever deliberately planned to disobey. 

“After you’re safely wed, you’re going going to complete your training under Jorali, as will your heir. Then, at festival time, you will bring aetheral to the Tower, as is your duty, as was your mother’s duty, and hers before you.”

The betrayal stung. Had Jorali had ever intended to help her investigate the missing aetheral, or had she been stalling all along? "And you're okay with this? For Amalai and the girls?" Amalai hadn’t known. Kala was sure of that. 

"A priestess does her duty," Jorali said stiffly, and Kala wondered for one wild moment whether she genuinely believed she was doing the right thing or if the old priestess was just too much of a coward to defy the High Priest. But in the end, it didn't matter: Kala would find no allies here. Maybe if she had not gone looking on her own, if she had waited, but... they would have only lied to her.

Better to know that the leaders of her people couldn’t be trusted. 

“You’re proposing to leave my clan without a priestess while Pakai clan has three, with three more in training!” her father Caipan objected. “At least let Amalie—” 

“She is your son’s wife,” the High Priest said with a shake of his head, but Kala hadn’t missed the subtle way he glanced at Jorali, and the subtle way Jorali had tightened her lips. The elder priestess would countenance the sacrilege of selling aetherals, but she would fight the loss of her daughter.

Her father’s face was stiff with fury. “Respectfully, Rukanui, my clan needs the exchange-gift. I hope you aren’t proposing our portion go to Pakai clan.” 

Even now, Kala hadn’t expected him to be so blatant about his priorities. “Do we, father? Are the children starving? Are the tulpi ill? Are we hunted by Hawksouls like in the days of old, when the Realmwalker saved us and asked only that we prepare and guard his armory?” 

“That was a long time ago, girl. The Realmwalker is probably dead.” 

Further argument was futile. He wouldn’t listen. 

“I see now that I was missing critical pieces of my training,” Kala said, forcing a smile. “I’m sure that Jorali’s instruction will be critical, once I wed Mahiai. Is there still time tonight, or shall we wait until morning?” 

“Go,” Rukanui told her. “Prepare for your wedding. And Kala? This is a matter for seniors. Say nothing or we will cut out your tongue.” 

Kala shuddered. No one else so much as blinked at the threat. 

* * * 

Kala was not permitted to speak with Tusiata, or even to see Mahiai, before the wedding. Only women directly involved in the upcoming nuptials were permitted in the festival tent. Even Healani’s presence was chaperoned by Jorali. Under normal circumstances, the senior priestess would have had no business in the Kukihoi clan tent, but with Kala’s mother dead and Kala due to marry, she was the obvious choice to perform the mother-rites. 

Healani kept shooting her confused glanced as the two brides-to-be helped style each other’s crownfeathers, but there was nothing Kala could say under Jorali’s disapproving glare. Nothing honest, anyway. Jorali couldn’t watch her forever, though, and they hadn’t cut out her tongue yet. 

Perhaps there was a line they were not yet willing to cross. Perhaps they thought she would go back to being an amiable member of the flock. Perhaps they thought her absence would be noticed. Too many people had seen her since she left Kukihoi clan, and the seniors could not silence them all. 

Healani helped fit her into the beaded white leather gowns tradition demanded of a bride. Its skirt was looser than anything she’d ever worn. Perhaps, if this was a wedding she wanted, she would have felt daring and beautiful. “I feel so exposed,” Kala whispered. 

Normally Healani would have grinned, maybe joked about how that was the whole point, but now she just squeezed Kala’s shoulder, trying for reassurance. “It will be fine. I’ll be right behind you.” 

It helped a little, but Healani was choosing to marry a man she loved, who she had decided on freely and by choice. Doubtless she thought Kala was conflicted about the choice to marry Mahiai.

She wasn’t conflicted; she was terrified. She had never defied her seniors to their faces before, and she didn’t know if she was brave enough to do it now. 

“Hush now. Do your duty and you’ll be fine.” Jorali said, fitting a slender leather strap to her brow, blinding her behind the opaque cloth. She led Kala silently out of the tent, and placed her hand in her father’s. 

The ritual was supposed to represent the trust she had placed in her parents, to let them guide her into adulthood. Fallen branches crunched beneath her feet, so different from the ice and snow she was used to. She felt so off-kilter in this priestly stronghold, where even the air was thick and cloying, even when the trade winds came to push away the sea. After three steps, she tripped, and grimly took it as an omen. 

“This is going to work out,” her father said, squeezing her hand. “You just need to do as you’ve been told, and our clan will recover from the mess you got us into.”

It took everything Kala had to stop herself from snatching her hand away and ripping off the veil. If she tried to run now, they’d maim her and find some way to blame her muteness on some innocent accident. 

Or maybe they’d boil her alive for the aetheral. If they were willing to bleed priestesses, how long would it be before they started to sacrifice troublesome young priests? 

The image of Tusiata’s living body being forced into Jorali’s cauldron while her granddaughters learned to wield the pine paddles made bile rise in the back of her throat. 

Kala tried to focus on the land beneath her feet and the sounds of the crowd she traveled through. The carnival aura of the previous night hadn’t abated. The sticky-sweet odor of euphorigum choked her despite the veil.

Once it had comforted her; as a child she had loved festivals, when the priests opened up their barrels and shared the fruits of their harvests. Weddings, when young men were permanently welcomed into the clans they’d been fostered to, had always been one of the most exciting parts. Even angriest of the rejected suitors had a good time when they got their first taste of sacred food and euphorigum and initiation into the camaraderie that would carry them through the rest of their lives.

She’d felt so superior, as a young girl watching new men embark upon the path she had been born to. But no matter what she had once naively thought, it wasn’t service to the Realmwalker that motivated them. 

Her father slowed. “Up you go,” he said, then lifted her from the hips, launching her into the air like a child. Kala flapped her wings once, twice, until strong arms caught her and hauled her up onto the little cliff overlooking the festival grounds.

Mahiai. It was part of the ritual. She forced her breathing to calm.

She still flinched when he removed her veil without warning.

Mahiai was resplendent in a bone-beaded white tunic thin enough — and tight enough — to display the muscular definition of his arms. Two seahawk feathers hung from leather thongs over his chest, symbols of prestige and his birth family’s connection to the High Priest. Only senior priests were permitted to hunt the seahawks, and only during trade years; they never came far enough inland for the clans to hunt.

The clans were gathered two bodylengths below, in clusters and mixed groups, as families who hadn’t seen their sons in seasons reunited with their beloveds, young priests mingled with friends they missed, storytellers regaled new audiences with tales that had grown stale in their own clans.

Would they ever tell the story of her mother’s death? 

High Priest Rukanui, a bare handful of winglengths away atop his podium, slammed a stone hammer against a thick sheet of imported copper. Feeling sick, Kala wondered when the shiny metal had been added to the ritual. “Let the weddings begin!” Rukanui shouted his words to the crowd, but he stared straight at her as he spoke, as though he could force her by sheer will to obey. 

The mountain at his back caught his words and threw them back to the crowd thrice as loud. Kala flinched. 

The gathered clans cheered. As they shouted encouragements and crude jokes, the words “Not yet!” escaped. Her mind went blank and her hand moved without her conscious volition. She yanked the cauldron at her throat hard enough to break the clasp. With the power of her fury, nearly rending her arm from its socket as she threw it into the crowd.

It bounced off someone's chest and fell to the ground, expanding instantly to full size. Those close enough to see gasped.

Not many got to witness the Realmwalker’s miracles with their own eyes. 

“Kala, what are you doing?” Mahiai hissed.

There wasn’t time to explain. Rukanui was already crossing the podium, his fingers clenched into furious claws. 

Words spilled out of her. “I serve the Realmwalker, not the priesthood,” Kala shouted. “I won’t bleed myself so they can hoard foreign copper and silk.” 

She could feel Mahiai stiffen beside her. “What does she mean, uncle?”

“It doesn’t matter,” Rukanui said, his disgust palpable. “You aren’t marrying her. Go join the other initiates while I deal with this.” 

“What?” Mahiai said. “No, I want to know what’s going on.” 

Kala flicked her eyes toward the gathered crowd. They watched the unfolding drama with whispered intensity, echoing Mahiai’s confusion with a quiet curiosity that gave her hope. 

“They’re selling idols the priestesses have spent generations creating,” Kala said, loud enough for everyone to hear. “Idols meant for the Realmwalker.” 

“That’s enough,” Jorali said, emerging from the bridal tent where she waited with Healani. “This is a matter for seniors, and you’ve abdicated your cauldron. Healani, go claim your—”

For the first time in her life, Kala interrupted a senior. “The seniors were meant to rule because they are wise, but trading away the Realmwalker’s idols is not wise. He will punish this betrayal.” 

The crowd murmured, but no one did anything. The instinct to obey ran too deep. 

Rukanui drew the gem-crusted mace that symbolized his rank. Ceremonial or not, it was heavy enough to break bone if it struck her. Her whole body flushed with terror, but she stood her ground. 

Mahiai stepped in front of Kala. “That’s your retort? You’ll beat her until she does as she’s told?” 

“It is the province of the priesthood to dictate the laws and enforce them.” Rukanui's knuckles were vivid white around the mace. “I rule that Kala of Kukihoi clan is to be shunned, to taste no fruit of the valley. Any who would argue will face the same punishment.” 

Kala’s spat at the injustice of it. “I serve the Realmwalker, not you!” The words were a shriek as Rukanui advanced, heedless of his nephew. Kala glared at him. “I would rather starve defying you than bleed myself dry obeying you, like my mother did.”

“Father, is it true?” Ereni asked, his voice cutting through the shocked gasps like spoon over soup fat. 

Caipan, his wings held rigidly against his back, said only, “Stay out of this, fool. You’ve a pregnant wife.” 

Kala wasn't surprised by her father's cowardice, but it hurt anyway. 

“Silence!” Rukanui roared, pointing his mace at Mahiai. Almost everyone obeyed. “Move, boy. This is your last warning.” 

Mahiai set his jaw and did not move. 

“I’m not bleeding myself, either,” Healani said, dropping the Kukihoi clan cauldron as though it burned. 

“Then starve!” Rukanui spat. 

Kala found Amalai’s eyes in the crowd. She looked stricken, but said nothing. Pregnant, with two children back home. Kala looked away and saw Tusiata. He held two carry-packs and had her parka thrown over one shoulder. 

“We can find food in the south,” Tusiata said, his voice heartbreakingly hopeful. “I don’t want to serve the priests. I only ever wanted to marry you. If you’ll have me, I mean.” 

Rukanui laughed angrily. “You’ll run to the very people you’ve decided it’s sacrilege for us to trade with? Hypocrites. Guards, collect them and—”

Gasps peppered the crowd, but most people just looked frightened. Kala lifted her chin, half-hoping he'd attack her right on stage. At least then, the clans would be forced to watch, to _see_ the brutality they were submitting to, by letting the priests rule them from their tower. 

“Let them go,” Jorali interrupted, sounding tired. “It’ll only cause trouble if they stay.” 

“We’re going too,” Healani said. Kala hadn't noticed Oeakoa move to her side, but there he was, his marriage-white tunic brilliant in the clfiffside sun. His lips were stress-tight, but he didn't contradict his bride. 

“Can I come too?” Mahiai said in a small voice. He sounded broken, and Kala’s heart ached for him. This morning, he’d thought he was marrying her and becoming the clan chief’s heir. Now, he’d publicly defied the High Priest he’d once thought to replace. “I know you probably don’t want to marry me, but—”

“Come south with us and I’ll marry you both,” Kala said firmly, and it was true. Both men loved her, she was sure of it now, and after today, how could she doubt they’d earned her trust? 

The Realmwalker could decide what to do about the sacrilege of His army when He returned. She wouldn’t be a part of it, and her heart leapt with hope at the idea that, as long as they left the Isle, neither would Tusiata _or_ Mahiai. 

“She’s a fool.” Rukanui grabbed his nephew’s arm. “Without the medicine we get from the Voldshee in exchange for aetheral, you wouldn’t be alive, boy. Do you think this is the first year we’ve traded idols to the south? The Realmwalker didn’t save you, _I_ did!” 

“Saving me doesn’t make up for starving and bleeding the others,” Mahiai said, yanking his arm way. “I’m marrying her, and Tusiata too, if he’ll have me. I don’t want to spend the next thirty years learning how to threaten people so I can control them.” 

“You’ll never survive there,” Rukanui warned. “I’ve been there. The air’s all wrong, and there are too many trees. You have no idea what foolishness this is.”

“Better to try to make a life for ourselves away from you, than starve and bleed under your tyranny,” Kala said, and turned her back on him. 

“We’ve already lost my wife and my daughter. Think about what you would be throwing away. What you'd be leaving behind,” Caipan said to Healani. Like Kala was dead, instead of standing mere rods away. “Kukihoi needs a priestess.” 

“You should have thought of that before you decided Rukanui’s promises were more important than mother’s life,” Kala said, lunached herself into the air to join Tusiata.

Mahiai followed, then Healani and Oeakoa in their wedding garb. And Kirken, and two dozen initiates, and a handful of junior priestesses, despite the pleas of their parents. 

Kala couldn't help but feel triumphant, even as she knew in her heart that Rukanui wouldn't let it end there. 

* * * 

Flying over the ocean was harder than Kala had imagined it could be. The air was different, wetter, harder to move through but less supportive of her wings in a way she couldn't quite articulate. Even the clouds were different, smashing and spinning into each other unpredictably, creating eddies and whirling spots that had nearly saw Kirken go toppling into the sea below. 

Kala bolted down after him before anyone else could react, tucking her wings against her body and diving with the unerring speed of a falcon diving after fish. The air itself fought her, thick and cloying, but she caught him, and helped him right himself, and together they began the hard slog of climbing back up to an altitude where they could breathe. 

"It's okay," Kala said. 

"I guess this is why only the priests ever do this," Kirken said. "Wouldn't want to think about my mother making this trip with my brother." 

Kala thought of Amalie. "No," Kala said. "I'm surprised the High Priest goes."

Kirken snorted. "He doesn't. Not like this. They pull him. They train the Tower's tulpi help.  It's supposed to be so he's rested enough to hunt falcon, only a high priest has the skill, but I think it's because the High Priest is always too old to make the trip without help." 

Kala pursed her lips. 

They weren't making good progress. "Do you think they'll follow?" 

He looked at her like she was brain-addled snowbird. "Of course.  Rukanui was already planning to cross the sea. Besides, if what you were saying is true, we're twenty bodies worth of priceless power that could be sold to mages." 

"Priceless," Kala said bitterly. "They put a price on it, didn't they." 

"I expect they'll overtake us by sunset," Kirken said. 

He was right. But by the time the caravan of priests caught up with Kala and her friends, three more families had joined them, carrying tents and travel-packs and bundles of pemmican snuck from clan stores before the priests thought to guard them.  

The sun set early in the shadowy straight tucked between the Voldshee Mountains and Eheu Isle, but Kirken was right. 

"Here they come," Mahiai said grimly. An arrow flittered past his ear. A woman screamed. 

Kala didn't know how to fight. She hadn't really been able to come up with a plan. The whole point of the priests was to serve as the Realmwalker's army, and to ensure that none of the clans fought one another. They trained for battle — for war. 

For suppressing rebellions exactly like the one they no doubt thought Kala had fermented. 

- [i] as a LEADER she can SEND Kirken down to fake falling and have him assassinate the High Priest while she distracts him. 
- [i] she should use the knife, fight with a knife while they try not to shed blood with their maces. 
- [i] fight like hawks vs. eagles. [goshawk vs. peregrine falcon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU_k0zYvDk8) See [[2022.03.21 Wings]]

* * * 

“Are you sure you’re okay with this?” Healani asked as she helped Kala slip back into her white marriage-gown. Even with the trade winds blowing, the air in the Voldshee mountains was warm enough that the revealing outfit was a relief to wear. 

Kala finished securing her last bone bead into her crownfeathers. “Kirken will do a good job with the ceremony.” 

“But two husbands?” 

“Don’t worry, Healani. We’ll figure it out,” Tusiata said, poking his head into the tent. He offered Kala his hand. “Are you ready?” 

Kala nodded. Together, they joined their new clan chief at the peak of the mountain, and married him. 

The next morning, they flew east, chasing rumors of taller mountains and higher peaks.
