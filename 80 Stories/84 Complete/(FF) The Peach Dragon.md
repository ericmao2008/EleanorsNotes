The musty smell of old clothes bloomed out of my burlap shopping bag as I dumped my holiday haul into the clothes hamper that had come with my Shenyang apartment. Newer clothes would have fit my outsized American body better, but after the Second Revolution, the new Government cracked down on sweatshop work and even on an expat teacher’s salary, I couldn’t afford to start from scratch with a tailor. 

I’d splurged on a cute yellow cardigan that probably began life as a knee-length sweater, a linen skirt so soft it must predate the war, and a heavily stained silk sari that would take months of work to salvage. I would start that project later. Breakfast in bed had been a holiday tradition since I was a child. I lived alone now, but I still indulged in the habit, refusing to let loneliness ruin what should be a joyful day. 

With a promise to rejoin the heated blankets on my bed soon, I pushed aside the curtain separating my bedroom from the rest of the apartment and was immediately hit with the scent of peaches, which wouldn’t have been so strange if it wasn’t winter in one of the coldest cities in China. Frowning, I hurried to the kitchen, half-expecting to find my grandmother holding a slice of peach pie à la mode, though she’d been dead the last sixteen years. 

Instead, a goat-sized dragon lay curled around a bright green flame. It looked up when I stepped into the kitchen. 

I yelped, then shook my head sharply to clear away what had to be an optical illusion. Probably just a snake or a—

“Amme Kojin Jones 44815486110052027?” It enunciated each individual number, and I lost a moment to sheer shock before I realized that it was trying to confirm my identity by reciting my government-issued identification number and birthdate. 

“Um,” I said. “Yes?” It had mispronounced my name, but I was used to that. 

“Amme Kojin Jones you are endangered.” 

I frowned, stung despite the cloud of surreality I'd stumbled into. “Why would you attack me? Or anyone else?” Some tiny corner of my mind noticed I was using the tone I normally reserved for obstinate students. That same detached little voice reminded me that I was talking to a dragon. Pearlescent wings and all.  

“You will not be attacked,” the dragon said. “You are endangered. Your species is dying.” 

“Okay,” I said, though counterarguments flashed breezily through my mind. Of all Earth’s species, humanity had been among those least impacted by industrialization and climate change. Global population growth had stabilized around the time that Africa finished industrializing, and we figured out how to synthesize food and purify water decades ago. I didn’t see a reason to try and convince the dragon, though. Instead I asked, “What am I supposed to do about it?” 

“You must be preserved.” 

My brow curled in on itself. “Me?” 

“You represent a unique cultural strain.” The dragon uncurled its body. Somehow, it filled the room, though only a moment before it had been no larger than her childhood dog. “You must be preserved. Carry with you what belongings you require.” 

I took a wary step back. “What if I don’t want to?” 

The green flame flickered, then encompassed us both. “You must be preserved. If you do not arrive in *Shiāno* with survival goods, alternatives will be synthesized for you.” 

I swallowed. I considered trying to fight, but—how could one fight a dragon? Or a flame? I was a schoolteacher. 

I did as I was told and filled my shopping sack with books, clothes, and food. 

I could probably manage for awhile with a basket of potatoes, my sewing kit, a chef’s knife and a sari. Maybe they could make me peach pie in *Shiāno*.
