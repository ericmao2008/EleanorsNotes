Plenty of lands were complete without **castles**. The **mountain** **kingdom** of Riorche, however, boasted **seventy** such monstrosities **poisoning** the surrounding woodlands with **garbage**. 

When King Leapell **returned** from his first diplomatic mission abroad, he had been **vocal** about the need to retire the antiquated fortresses, and consequently many otherwise-serene landed ladies spent many summer nights — and even more **syllables** — eloquently lamenting the obvious decline of his faculties and therefore, inevitably, his family's dynasty. Within five years, a new king stood before the grand **board** of Riorch's royal **keys**, and vowed that he would, of course, uphold the sacred duties of his family line and defend the heritage of his people. 

The woodlands survived; the new king's sole innovation was a tax on trash, and he used the revenues to sponsor several lovely serenades.
