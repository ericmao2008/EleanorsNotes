	* #nonfic/articleSeed/afterword A deep dive on how efficient taxes actually caused problems for the British government based on [[2021.10.18 Taxes]] & 
		* [[collecting taxes is cheaper than controlling labor forces]]
		* [[too much taxation leads to starvation]]
		* [[Mesoamerican governments distributed taxed food in times of famine]]
		* [[the technical and psychological design rationale behind everyday things]]
		* [[We Condone It by Our Silence by Rebecca Futo Kennedy]] -- Athenian taxes (import taxes vs. local taxes vs. extracted taxes)
	* Baltimore vs Annapolis vs st Mary's and smuggling, see also that piece on where pirates fit into the social hierarchy
