# Puff Pastries & Women’s Bane

## one

Guine Sanele clicks her nails together quietly. The rose paint coating them hides her claws, but nothing can disguise the dangerous glint in her eyes. “I’m going shopping.”

Blaen gives her a lazy smile and croons, “No, you are not,” and she knows they’ve reached the _complicated_ part of that relationship. Blaen, with his greased-back hair and hawk-handsome profile, _claims_ to be Sunsworn to serve her, but the reality is much more complicated.

Rather than fight a losing battle with a man who has already dug in his heels, the young noblewoman changes tacks. “If I stay cooped up in this place any longer, I’ll go mad,” she declares.

_This place_ is Sanele Manor in Bideon, owned by Guine’s aunt Lisabina. Because Lisabina is also the ranking matron of the Bideon enclave's priesthood, there are several other mages in residence, along with the servants necessary to keep such a place running smoothly.

Guine has spent the last three days cooped up behind these walls and is tired of it—raised as a nomad traveling from village to village with her grandmother, having a formal place of residence is still unusual to her. Being _confined_ to that place of residence has been all but intolerable.

Blaen doesn’t budge. “Just because you’ve earned your claws doesn’t mean you aren’t still vulnerable, Guine,” he tells her patiently.

She wouldn’t point out that she knew all that. She _wouldn’t._ “I don’t care.”

“You had better,” Blaen says, voice suddenly grim. “You’re a noble.”

“I am well aware of that,” she snaps, though it is true she spends most of her time trying to forget that part of her nature.

He ignores her, overriding her protest with his deeper voice. “Since you have no Court, you’re more vulnerable than you should be.”

Her eyes go cold. “You know why I refuse to establish a Council.” He cannot help but be aware of the gossamer dream that prophesied her death on the day four gifted mages formally pledged their service to her.

Without a Council, she cannot rule. It is the law and more than the law; it is a truth of power.

This time, he focuses on her and acknowledges the statement. “Yes, and I approve. But that isn’t my point,” he tells her silkily. “You have no Council. This is Dejale. Simply being a noble here is a dangerous thing and you can’t afford to tempt fate. Only your grandmother’s reputation protects you, and her health is slowly failing. You have one mage—” somehow, his expression doesn’t twist with distaste as he mentions the other male tied to her “—and one Sunsword devoted to your safety. That is _all._ Your power outranks Dacia’s, but that makes you a threat.”

She tries not to sound sulky, she really does. “My grandmother—”

“Is just another reason Vasile Petrescu is ruthlessly devoted to securing his Countess’ rule,” he shouts at her. Sunswords make poor bodyguards; they haven’t the temper for it. “You come from a notable family and you have made many friends in your travels. If you wanted her throne, you could take it.”

Guine unsheathes her claws. “If I wanted her throne, I would have taken it already.”

The Sunsword throws his hands in the hair before bringing two fingers to the center of his forehead. “Your skills bring you some measure of protection from assassination, but I will _not_ stand idly by while you wave your skirts under the nose of every ambitious cutthroat in the city.”

She slumps. Sunswords make poor bodyguards but are excellent on the offense; she will not win this argument today. “Are you done?”

The adrenaline flush of battle stains his cheeks. “Are you?”

She sighs. “Fine,” she mutters with ill grace.

“Then we’re agreed,” he says. With a placating smile, he picks up a deck of cards. “What would you like to play?”

Sunsword and Duchess practice the southern game of triumvirate for nearly an hour, and when Guine finally takes a winning trick they are interrupted by a knock. Guine watches Blaen’s temper snap to the edge of violence before he reins it in. Only then does she test who is outside her door with a tendril of her indigo power. “Come in,” she calls.

A servant enters carrying a silver tray overflowing with food. It is a small platter by the cook’s standards, so Guine represses her habitual snarl. The woman—the staff knew better than to send another man into a Sunsword’s presence while his temper is strained by his tempestuous charge—sits the tray down on the table before unobtrusively exiting the room.

Blaen doesn’t bother trying to convince Guine to eat, though she is sure it had been he who slipped the thought into the cook’s head. It is the kind of thing he would do. Still, they barely pause in their card game, dealing the next hand as though nothing had happened. Guine’s is garbage but she has a feeling that Blean’s is just as bad. She is so focused on winning that she barely notices and does not glare when he picks up one of the sandwiches and eats it in two quick bites.

When her stomach grumbles she doesn’t think twice about choosing one of the small stuffed pastries she loves and popping it into her mouth. The cook had developed the recipe on her own, and the savory herbs flavoring the cheese are truly delicious—an opinion that Blaen does not share, but he had probably requested them for her sake. Out of belated habit, she tests the plate for poison, now that she’d accidentally acknowledged it was there.

She pales.

Standing so abruptly she bangs her knee against the table and hurries to a wastebasket. She hates to do it, but she sticks two fingers against the back of her tongue and vomits.

“Poisoned,” she gasps once she has emptied her stomach. To reassure the rapidly spiraling Sunsword beside her, she says, “I’ll be fine” and stands, wiping her mouth.

That is all he needs to know, and this time, when violence runs crystal through his veins, he has no desire to rein it in. She feels him snap a shield over the platter and then he is gone from her side, striding toward the door with murder in his eyes. He leaves the room without bothering to open the door, passing through the wood like a ghost. Through the physical shield he has placed around the room—trapping her there—she hears him roar for the servant who had delivered the food. The wineglasses on the table clink delicately against one another. He has used a Sunsword’s gifts to project his voice through the entire mansion.

Mother of Stars, she thinks, closing her eyes. Don’t kill anyone, Blaen, she sends along the thread of their connection, falling back on the threads of etiquette to make it an order.

Why shouldn’t I? he snarls back, the emotional undertones so icy-hot she flinches, though she knows his cold rage was on her behalf.

This is my grandmother’s house, she reminds him, as gently as she knows how; his mood is fragile. Any punishments are hers to give.

Besides, she is fine. She detected the poison in time and altered metabolism will have no trouble burning up whatever remains. Whoever had slipped the women’s bane into those pastries, she knows, would soon be in much worse shape.

The thought of the winding, climbing, poison justice the Ivy Coven is known for exacting shakes some of the murderous intent from Blaen’s emotional resonance. It is replaced with satisfaction.

“Mother of Stars,” she whispers, feeling shaky.

#### three

The cook, the housekeeper, and the servant stand before their elderly employer. The cook trembles, the servant is pale, and the housekeeper’s lips are dangerously thin and white. Guine sits quietly flanked by the two men who serve her, albeit informally. Both bristle with protective outrage. Since she is perfectly safe and had barely been harmed, she leans her knee against the leg of the mage to her left and puts her hand on her Sunsword’s forearm. It calms them, but not completely.

“What, exactly, happened.” Guine’s sweetly agèd grandmother is gone; in her place blazes the full glory of an Ivy Matron. Lisabina looks at the housekeeper, as the woman in charge of the manor and all its servants, as she asks the question. Despite the rage sparking through the room, it would be inappropriate to circumvent her authority.

“I’m not entirely sure,” the housekeeper says, and her voice is strained. It is obvious that she is displeased by this fact.

The Matron looks to the cook but says nothing. The cook, who has come to the recently and has only a shaky grasp on the local dialect, gulps, but she answers the question. “I cooked up the stuffed pastries Lady Guine likes,” she says, acknowledging her responsibility. “But I certainly didn’t poison ‘em! I like working for the Sanele family, having so many Ivy sistren doesn’t bother me a whit,” she declares stoutly despite her obvious fear. “Me maw was a Sister, and so’s me sib’s wife.”

“We know,” Lisabina says, her eyes lightening with a touch of humor.

Now it is the cook’s lips who thin as she realizes it was not her skill alone that earned her such a plum—if stressful—position.

The servant girl needs little prompting to convince her to speak. “I couldn’t have poisoned the pastries,” she protests. “I just carried ‘em.”

Now the Matron’s eyes rest on the Sunshield who has attached himself to her granddaughter, and thus, to her by proxy, for she is the matriarch of their branch of the family, small as it may be. He still vibrates with the aftereffects of rage, but he knows that he must answer her silent question. “I ordered a plate of food from the kitchen,” he bites out. “Lady Guine needed to eat something. A bit after it arrived, I ate a sandwich. I didn’t test it for poison because it came from this kitchen—” it is a trust he will no longer extend after today “—but suffered no ill effects. Lady Guine had a pastry. Seconds after she put it in her mouth, she ran to throw up. She told me it was poisoned. I shielded the pastries, shielded the room, and gathered everyone involved here.”

Lisabina nods and finally looks to her granddaughter, the young noble she treasures but wishes was not one of the rare mages with the landsense gift. She would be safer that way, as today proves.

“I tested the platter out of habit,” she admits. “There was aconite in all of the pastries. I threw it up to save myself the effort of fighting the effects.” She does not say whether or not she thought she might have succeeded. Blaen disapproves when she admits vulnerabilities and approves even less when she shares what she can survive, believing it encourages her enemies into more effective attacks.

For once, she does not dispute his wisdom.

“There was women’s bane in the pastries.” Lisabina uses the common name of the plant, which blooms in winter, rather than the term Ivy Covens use for the poison it can be made into.

“A fatal dose if I had eaten enough. The bitterness was masked by the other flavors of the dish.”

“We grow winter women’s bane in the gardens,” Lisabina observes mildly. “I believe it has been harvested recently.” She pauses, eyes twitching as she focuses on a conversation only she can hear. “Crina was responsible and is on her way.”

The middle-aged Ivy Sister arrives within moments. Her mother is one of Lisabina’s most trusted confidants. She is a large woman despite her metabolic enhancements and shows up out of breath. “It’s missing,” she admits before she has completely regained it.

Lisabina’s eyes grow cold and distant and the very air is laced with her displeasure. “How could you let that happen?” she wants to know. Every Ivy Sister is taught to keep her supplies locked in a safe, protected place.

“I don’t know,” she stutters. “I remember using it two days ago. I needed ginger to detoxify some of the supply enough to use in a tonic—”

The cook groans, cutting her off. “You’re the one who asked where we got our herb containers, aren’t you?” she demands. “You left a cut up, poisonous plant in my kitchen in the same kind of container my herbs are in? Someone could have been killed!” She is too outraged to hold her tongue in such powerful company.

Lisabina’s expression has not warmed. “Someone almost was.”

The cook gulps. Crina has better self-control.

Both are banished from the mansion—but the cook is given references.

Not even Crina’s mother objects.
