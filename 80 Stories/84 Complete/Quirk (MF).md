"Any of 'em mages?" Jorse watched an army of spear-wielding quadrapeds storm across the snowy steppe.

"Hard to say, sir," his spotter said. "I just see green."

Jorse hated the quirk of breeding that left him, the strongest mage of Sul, dependent on the senses of a subordinate.

The best pianist he'd ever heard was deaf; Jorse shrugged & released a wave of purple power.

"Now?"

The spotter grunted. "Still green."

Time to stoop to more primitive measures. 

Jorse poured magic down into the dirt; it arose, a hardened wall. The quadrupeds roared in rage.
