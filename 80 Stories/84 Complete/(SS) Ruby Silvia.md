My brother drove out of the city as if the old interstate was a motor speedway. I just laughed and cranked up the stereo. Werewolves love nothing if not speed, and the little red corvette purred as she hit triple digits. 

It was a beautiful day for a drive. The sun was high in the bright blue sky, which was dotted by fluffy white clouds. The roads were predictably empty, as cars these days were more trouble than they were worth to keep running without gasoline. Despite the best efforts of the local gremlin population, though, the Savage River Pack had managed to keep her running.              

What surprised me was that the Alpha had let Duke drive the thing all the way to the city to pick me up from university. Duke said it was a graduation present, that he was there, but he had arrived a day earlier than planned…             

Oh. 

I turned down the radio and shouted over the wind, “Duke?”              

He took his attention off of the road long enough to look over at me. “Yeah?”              

“How much trouble are you going to get into for ‘borrowing’ the car?” I asked, straining to be heard.              

“Not too much,” he replied, teeth bared.              

I shook my head fondly, knowing there was nothing I could do and touched that he had defied the Alpha to be the one to pick me up. Duke was so reckless. I had always loved that about him.              

I propped my bare feet up on the dash, unworried by the stain my skin would put on the leather; Duke would be cleaning it tomorrow, anyway.               

Cranking the radio back up, I curled up in the bucket seat and enjoyed the clean air. Finally, after two years of university training, I was allowed to escape the smells and confines of urban life.               

I was going home.

I slammed the door of the Corvette as I launched myself from the passenger seat, heedless of my barefoot state and vibrating with fury. My lips were pulled back far enough from my teeth that any sane man would have run for the hills.              

Duke always had been reckless.               

As I paced back and forth along the property line, eyes glued to the bulldozers and concrete he had brought me here to see, he watched me. Finally, as though this urban invasion of my home wasn’t enough trauma for one day—one supposedly triumphant day—he told me the real news. “Father was killed.”              

“Why didn’t you tell me before?”              

He shifted his stance warily. “Mother wanted you to see for yourself.”              

The heart in my chest felt as dead as chivalry as I whispered, “How did it happen?”              

Duke spat his disgust onto the torn ground. “They shot him.”              

My rage cooled, turning from fire to ice.               

“They thought he was rabid,” Duke went on to explain, as if that was any explanation at all.              

“How many are dead?” I demanded as I resumed pacing, staring at the cordoned off area with renewed hatred. The pack would have taken vengeance; I knew it not only because such was our way, but because I knew my mother, whose grief would have spiraled into fury. Nothing stops a furious Alpha bitch; not magic, not steel.               

“Six. None of ours.”              

Of course not. No one with the magic, strength or savvy to stop a full-scale werewolf attack would be involved in the accidental shooting of a werewolf, especially not an Alpha.               

“How long has this been going on?” I asked, gesturing toward the machines.               

“We’re not sure,” Duke admitted. I understood; it was just outside of our territory, not on it. Border patrols were done often but not over the whole 54,000 acres at a time. “Not long,” he continued. “We haven’t had a hunt out this far since summer, and the last patrol listed in the logs was February before the blizzard.” It was May. “We found out when we found out about Papa; Mother only knew he was dead.               

“Papa was alone?”               

Duke shrugged. “He was walking the borders. Mother usually goes but she was feeling under the weather.              

That worried me; werewolves don’t normally get sick. We have a relatively high mortality rate, it’s true, but sickness isn’t a common cause of death. “What’s wrong with her?” I asked quietly, as if it mattered.              

Duke grimaced. “Just a headache, it’s nothing to fret over; she’d spent the morning putting Ana in her place.”              

My lips tightened. Ana had been a thorn in my side since childhood, crying nepotism and failing to recognize that purer bloodlines do engender greater power.               

“She’s the most dominant bitch in the pack except for Mother, with you gone,” Duke explained, as if I needed the reminder. “She was fighting for Beta status.”              

I curled my lip. “Not fucking likely,” I said.              

For the first time that day, Duke grinned. “That’s what Mother said.”              

I nodded. “Take me home,” I said, letting my eyes sweep the area that had once been an abandoned quarry, hardly of any concern. “I need to talk to Mother.”              

“She wants to talk to you.”              

I bet she did.              



---



No angry faces awaited us when Duke pulled into the parking space reserved for the corvette. At this juncture, I wasn’t surprised. As I looked back on my worry that Duke had defied his dominant’s orders, it seemed as though my concern had belonged to another woman entirely; one with a father and her remembered home to return to.               

I shook my head, sending red curls flying into disarray.               

“You okay?” Duke asked me.               

I tucked tendrils of hair behind my ears and did my best to reassure him. “This wasn’t how I expected to come home.”               

“At least you’ve got your degree.”              

It was a cold comfort as I excited the car and faced the Pack—some of it, anyway. Not everyone had gathered at the sound of the car; obviously, not everyone had been close enough to hear the engine as it approached, nor free enough of tasks to drop what they were doing and see.               

Still, enough people approached to make me nervous.               

I faced the porch were my mother stood, flanked by a man I didn’t recognize. He topped her by at least a foot, perhaps more; werewolves, like many species, breed their women smaller than their men, but this one stood a good bit taller than my brother, as well.               

Silvians are smaller than the average human; we rarely weigh in at more than our canine counterparts, when all was said and done. My medical training suggested that it had a lot to do with how many of us were born twins and triplets. It was just another facet of life we had to deal with.              

This man, however, did not seem to suffer from the drawbacks of lycanthropy, though his proximity to Mother indicated his status as a member of the Pack; a high-ranking one, at that. Then I wondered if his presence had anything to do with my father’s death and had to stifle a growl as I held out my hands for Mother to take at her leisure.               

“Ruby,” she said. “Thank the Goddess you’re home. It’s been difficult without you.”              

I was worried about how tired she sounded, though the warmth in her tone was reassuring; she truly was glad to see me home, and not only because of the troubles that had befallen us. I squeezed her hands. “It’s been difficult to be gone.”              

“I know, but it was necessary. You learned well, I hope?”              

“Yes, Mother,” I said, itching to cut to the chase.              

“Good,” she said. “Come inside, then. We must prepare.”              

I bit my tongue against asking the obvious ‘for what,’ but I was curious. It wasn’t that we weren’t facing a litany of ‘for what’s, but I wanted to know which one she had in mind.              

She told me soon enough, and my heart sank at the knowledge.  “The funerals will be held at midnight.”              

“Plural?”              

She looked so weary. “I will be joining your father. It has been decided.”              

“By who?” I demanded, though I should have known. Truly, I did—I just wasn’t willing to admit it. I had been away from Pack life long enough that my tongue had learned to follow my heart.               

She smiled wanly at me. “You’re home,” she told me, and my heart sank. “I needn’t hang on any longer. I’m not interested in finding another mate; I’m too old and I loved him too much. I refuse to waste away in my own body; I will join my ancestors at the cliffs, and then the new Alphas will be decided.”               

I held back a sniffle with only the greatest effort of will. “You won’t be here to guide us with this new problem?” I tried hard not to make it an accusation, but in my heart of hearts I knew that I had failed.              

She didn’t hold it against me, and said, gently, “My dear, you know better than that.”              

My heart sank. “How many males have gathered?” I asked. Only in status reports could I find my calm; it was humiliating, yet somehow reassuring. I had always had faith in numbers.              

“A fair amount; it is of no consequence. Your concern is for the women. Leave the men to themselves.”              

“Mother, you know I have no desire to be the Alpha,” I demurred.               

Her voice was like a whiplash as she said, “This is not about desire, daughter! This is about what is best for the pack.”              

“I am not!”               

“Midnight marks the zenith of the moon’s power. There will not be time for the outlier females to gather as there has been for the men; it will be you and Anathema who fight for the honor, and I will not have her leading this pack!”               

I wondered briefly whether my refusal to fight for the honor would keep Mother chained among the living, but dismissed the thought as unworthy. “I can’t promise that I can beat her in a fair fight,” I said, suddenly wary. I was the stronger dominant, it was true, and the smarter, and the hunts I led were more successful than hers, but she had always outmatched me alone.               

“There is nothing fair about a succession fight,” Mother said.              

The thought did not reassure me.              



---



Dusk came and went. Mother dismissed me to see to my things, and so I did, pitching my tent and stowing what belongings I considered mine inside. It didn’t take me long, but the sun had long since set when I emerged and slipped off of the tiny square of property considered mine and mine alone.              

A thin miasma of despair clung to me as I trod the old trail leading to the meeting grounds. Once, the clearing had been a Ranger’s station, flanked by swing sets and a pool, but the days where the State ran Savage River Forest were long gone. Only the gutted building and its satellite campsites remained, linked to the highway by the dirt road that Duke had driven me down.              

As I emerged from the trees, I turned my face toward the moon. It was full; full of power, full of promise.               

I didn’t want to be Alpha. No sane person would. The adage that you’re only good for something if you fight against it may be true, but it didn’t change my lack of desire. Only duty kept me moving.               

As I faced the moon, it occurred to me that I might get lucky; not all ‘lone wolf’ werewolves were alone, and some of the men might bring sisters or girlfriends along. If word had spread about the vacancy in the Savage River Pack, single females might come seeking strong contenders to start a pack of their own with. It didn’t have to come down to me or Ana.              

The thought cheered me, but it was not my main concern.              

The full moon had reminded me of something else; it was time to shift.              

Some myths lie. Werewolves—at least those descended from Rhea Silvia, as I was, have no physical need to change shape at the full moon. Ours was a spiritual need; our reaction to the full moon was born out of longstanding tradition. Like our ancestors before us, the generations upon generations of men and women who had lived and died since the days of Rome, we shifted to show our appreciation for the gift that the Huntress, the Lady of the Moon, had given us.              

This was not to say that the shift was easy; no sacrifice is pleasant, even when performed willingly. The change from human to wolf hurt like all bloody hell. I have heard the pain described, but never captured.              

Only the knowledge that it would be over soon—no, only the knowledge that to reverse the change would hurt far worse—kept me going as my bones melted and blood dripped into the grass. Bile coated portions of my body not designed to endure it, and only my dysfunctional vocal chords prevented a scream as acid ate my insides. My hair fell out, disintegrating before it hit the ground, like my blood had, and fur sprouted fast enough to elicit an unbearable urge to itch.              

It was an ugly process, all told.               

Then, so is sex.              

This had its perks, as well.               

A feeling of well-being suffused my freshly-shaped bones as soft rays of moonlight danced in my sandy red fur. It was over.               

I rolled over into the grass to scratch a residual itch and looked up to find a male I didn’t know staring down at me. I must have looked comical, the way I scurried to my feet so fast, unwilling to even seem submissive and unprepared before an unknown—even in my own territory. My lips pulled back from my teeth, just a little. I didn’t like being caught off guard.               

He moved closer to sniff me. Once I recognized him, I let him. He was too big to be anyone but the male who had been with Mother.               

He smelled good, like Pack. My guard dropped and I wagged my tail.               

Together we trotted off to find the rest of the Pack. They weren’t far.              



---



After we finished the hunt and returned to human form, Mother prepared to speak.               

Between fifteen and twenty—I had been gone away too long if I couldn’t name the pack strength at any given time, but there had been little choice—blanketed human bodies sat in the moonlight. We could smell the deer we had killed for the ceremony, and though the human nose does not find raw meat appealing, I heard more than one stomach rumble as Mother finished the last of the preparations.              

Our rites were neither complicated nor sacred. We all watched as Mother finished gutting the carcass that was strung up over the stone altar in the center of the field.               

Though I, too, was hungry after such a long chase, my attention was focused on the altar, not the meat. Generations of work had gone into the stone slab. Every flat inch of it was covered in carvings and polished until it shone like silver instead of gray. It was a masterwork of devotion and art, and I, ever religious, had a special prayer to pray.               

I knew better than to tempt fate with specifics, so I simply wished things well as I focused on the altar with all of a hunter’s strength of purpose. I was still praying, eyes closed, mantra running through my mind, tattered blanket tight around my nude body to ward off the midnight chill, when Mother began talking.              

Like everyone else, I listened.              

“As Alpha of the Savage River Pack of Silvian werewolves,” Mother began, “it is my responsibility to lead the thanksgiving of the Ceremony of the Moon’s Gift. What some of you don’t yet know is that this will be my last act as the Alpha bitch of this pack, and I can think of no more rewarding task. This ceremony has been with us for uncounted generations and it is my unalloyed pleasure to stand before you all and honor our patron Goddess, the Lady of the Moon—the Huntress. It is she whom we consecrate the fruits of our labors, and the venison we offer her tonight is as always a mere token, a symbol to remind us that our every hunt, our every act, is possible only with her grace and due to her gift.               

“Friends, family, we stand together when we salute Diana, no matter where else we stand apart.”              

It was a short speech, and its message was a familiar one—but no less profound for all that. A soft sigh spread through the pack as the venison shimmered and disappeared, only to return as a pile of bite-sized and well-cooked chunks.               

It was a good sign.               

We ate.              



---



We all stood by as Mother embraced her fate. There was nothing else we could have done—even Duke, irrepressible and anti-authority as he might have been, had never actually disobeyed a direct order from his Alpha… and even among humans, it was impossible to stop a determined suicide.               

“Determined” epitomized my mother.               

The whole pack waited silently, faces solemn and sad, when Mother dove over the cliff’s edge, except for my eldest sister. Anathema cracked a smile when Mother jumped, and for that affront alone I was willing to fight to be Alpha.               

There was no way in seven Hells I would let her take my mother’s place.               

Anathema had always resented me. Since we were children, she had hated that Mother thought I was more qualified than she to lead. She was convinced that, but for an accident of birth, she would have held my place in the pack.               

She may have been right, but the point was moot—my parents had both been Alphas, and she was flawed.               

I remembered when we had been children. She’d pushed me out of the way to get to dinner faster; not uncommon among wolves, or even humans. She’d been bigger than I, and I hadn’t been strong enough to prevent her from overpowering me.              

In the end, she regretted it; I slipped laxatives into her milk the next morning.               

Father just laughed when Anathema complained, trying to get me punished. Crying favoritism, she’d gone to Mother, who had promptly punished her for trying to undermine the authority of an Alpha and sternly informed her that size wasn’t anything.              

I’d been praised for handling the situation on my own instead of running to the authorities. My parents’ plate had been full enough without my adding petty sibling rivalries to their problems.               

After that, and a few more, similar, incidents, the rivalry had become significantly less petty. She may have been my half-sister, but there was nothing sororal about our feelings for each other. Mother was no longer around to demand that her children remain civil to one another. There would be no more pretenses of friendliness.              

We all felt it when Mother died, but even a casual observer could have marked the precise moment; Anathema and I immediately turned to face one another, and the rest of the pack backed away.              

I laughed. Despite the grief I felt in the wake of Mother’s passing, I couldn’t help it. Anathema wanted to fight me? She was a fool.               

She’d forgotten something so basic that I’d forgotten it too. When an Alpha dies, her power doesn’t pass with her. It doesn’t stay in limbo until the next leader is decided; it passes to the heir.              

I may have been gone for two years, but Mother had never revoked my Beta status.               

Mother was right. This wasn’t going to be a fair fight.               

I’d been so focused on the fact that there would be a fight to determine my right to be Alpha that I’d forgotten that it would be Anathema contesting my right to take Mother’s place. We weren’t coming at the situation from equal places within the Pack.              

I outranked her. She might have been stronger than me, but the kind regard of the ancestors was on my side.               

It might not be enough; she still outweighed me and Anathema on her best day was more vicious than me on my worst, but I had the power of an Alpha behind me. It was new power, unused to me and not something I had adapted to, but it was power nonetheless.              

They say knowledge is power.              

Power is power.               

“Why are you laughing?” Anathema sneered as she circled me.              

I smiled. “You aren’t going to win, big sister.”              

Her eyes flashed. “You haven’t beaten me in a fair fight since you were eight.”              

My smile grew. “We haven’t had a fair fight since we were five,” I retorted.              

She lunged.               

I stepped aside faster than I should have been able to.              

She landed on all fours, in a crouch. “Two years in the city made you soft,” she taunted.              

“You have no idea what a city is like,” I told her, “if you think that it makes anyone soft.”              

I heard a soft growl of appreciation from someone in the circle of Silvians surrounding me, but I didn’t spare the attention to sort out who it came from.               

I jumped into the air as she came at me again and I could sense her sneer; I didn’t need to see it.               

She wasn’t expecting me to stop her when she was in midair and knock her to the ground. She still outweighed me, but she was underneath me, and I’d knocked the wind out of the bitch.               

She heaved upwards, trying to push me off of her. I kneed her in the stomach before she’d finished the movement and leaned my forearm against her windpipe.               

Her eyes fogged over for half a second before she shook her head sharply and renewed her struggles.               

She reached for my hair. I’d let it grow out in the city, rather than deal with strangers coming near me with sharpened knives. I arched my back away from her just enough to let her shove my weight off of her.              

I jumped up rather than let her flip me.               

She was on her feet nearly as fast as me.               

A thought occurred to me. I laughed again.              

Her eyes narrowed; I’d never acted like this before. “Why are you laughing?” she demanded.              

I smiled again. “You just don’t understand,” I said, and launched myself at her.               

One of the most important talents of an Alpha female is the ability to shift shape quick and smooth. It’s what lets them—us—carry our babies to term when other women miscarry with heartbreaking ease.              

I was a wolf before I hit the ground.               

Anathema’s eyes were wide and she smelled like sudden fear.               

An eighty pound wolf has no trouble killing a human, even one with a killer instinct, so long as the human isn’t armed.               

She hadn’t expected to need weapons. It was too late for a shift. I saw her sense of her own death in her eyes, but I also saw a stubborn determination to do as much damage as she could before she went down.              

My sister would go down swinging.               

I began to circle her, as she’d done at first.               

I sensed her confusion. I wasn’t usually offensively-minded. My preferred methods were usually sneakier; I usually contented myself with creative revenge. I am not by nature violent.              

Sometimes the best defense is a swift, vicious offense.               

I had been waiting years for this.               

I lunged.              

She expected me to go for her face.              

I hit her in the stomach with my shoulder. An eighty pound human is small—in the city I was mistaken often for a child. An eighty pound wolf is average, and dangerous.               

She staggered, but didn’t fall, and managed to cuff me across the muzzle with enough force that she cut her hand on my teeth.               

She knew better than to be prone before a murderously-minded wolf.               

She sidestepped my next lunge, and my next.               

I hated fights.              

They took too damned long.               

I stopped lunging.               

I’d figured it out; I had the power.               

All I had to do was stay alive, and it would stay mine.               

If she got bored and quit, she would be removed from the Pack.              

If she got bored and lunged for me, I’d rip out her throat.               

I’d always been more patient than she.               

She started edging in closer as I circled. She tried to reach for my neck to twist and break it.               

It might have worked if I hadn’t expected it.               

She might have had longer arms than I, and a longer reach, and she might have been fast—but I was faster and she didn’t have the advantage of surprise.               

I turned my head and bit down on her hand, tearing a hole through her palm.               

She yelped and pulled away, putting herself out of the way of my jaws.               

I closed the distance, following up my advantage, moving as she did.               

On a deer, the underbelly is vulnerable. On a human, the stomach is still soft, but it is awkwardly placed when dealing with a bipedal creature.               

I buried my jaws in the arm I hadn’t already injured.               

Blood dripped into the grass and into my mouth. I swallowed convulsively, but didn’t let go even when she tried to punch me in the side of the face. I didn’t let go until she went for my eye with the thumb of her mauled hand.               

I tore free, but my vision was blurry. The blood in my eye didn’t help.               

I lunged and missed.              

This time it was her laughter ringing through the night air, mocking.               

I growled and began to circle again.               

I leapt, and she tried to kick me. If she’d connected to the jaw, she probably could have knocked me unconscious. She didn’t, and she off-balance when I collided with her midriff.               

She fell.               

I tore out her throat.               

The artery gushed blood, and it matted my fur.               

My sister was dead.
