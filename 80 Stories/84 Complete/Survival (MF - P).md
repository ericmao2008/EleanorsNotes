- [i] I'm not sure what kind of analysis I could do for this that isn't covered under [[2022.01.26a broken heart syndrome and human sacrifice customs]] unless it's to discuss the role of fire in human death customs (pyres / witch burning). That would probably be a good topic for [[Freelance copywriters]]. 

```poem
Suppose you've found yourself
Under the protection of a conqueror, foreign-born
Right at a time when you most desire freedom for
    the women of the world â€” I must warn:
Vanity aside, the irony will burn
Into the dawn of heathen days and past the
Veil of death, yet
A widow as cursed as I for living still surely knows
Lingering past the death of love is sacrifice
    as surely as embracing the wind's flame breath

 ```
